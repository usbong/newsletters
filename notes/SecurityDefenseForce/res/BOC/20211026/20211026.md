> October 26, 2021

> On October 22, 2021, a composite team of the Bureau of Customs-Manila International Container Port, National Bureau of Investigation, and Philippine Coast Guard conducted a follow-up operation in a showroom in Xavierville, Loyola Heights, Quezon City suspected to be storing alleged smuggled luxury cars and other motor vehicles with an estimated value of Php60,000,000.

> An intelligence report received that a garage located at the said area is also part of the R33 car dealer and storing alleged smuggled imported luxury cars prompted the issuance of a Letter of Authority (LOA) signed by the Commissioner of Customs against the owner/s, representative/s or anyone in possession of the imported goods to be found.

> Armed with the LOA and Mission Order, the implementing team composed of MICP Customs Intelligence and Investigation Service, NBI, and PCG Task Force Aduana inspected the showroom resulting in the discovery of another batch of luxury cars such as Porsche turbo, Mini Cooper, Mercedes Benz Kompressor, Toyota Sprinter, Mitsubishi Lancer Evolution, Hinda Civic and an SUV Lexus Lx570, and others. Also stored were several motorcycles and big bikes such as BMW, Vespa, and Ducati.

> The inventory of the goods found was also conducted on the same day led by the customs examiner and was witnessed by CIIS MICP, PCG, and representative/s of the showroom.
