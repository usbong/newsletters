### SELECT PARTS

> 经历了33年的统一之路，德国总理朔尔茨说，德国统一成就辉煌，但仍须要继续努力，这说明统一路的艰难。（路透社）

Having experienced 33 years of a unified Germany, German Prime Minister SCHOLZ says that German unification has shown its brilliance, yet efforts still need to be continued, thus elucidating difficulties in a unified Germany. (Reuters)

> 今年是德国统一的33周年纪念，在10月3日德国平添一天假期，但在全德各地，没有看见国旗遍地、强调“民族主义”的景象，

This year is the 33rd year anniversary of German Unification. While Germany has put October 3 as a national holiday, the national flag, which emphasizes "Nationalism", is not to be seen in all parts of the country.

> 一来德国是欧盟成员，二来德国人对极端民族主义恶果有过切肤之痛，官方不愿意强调民族主义，在回忆历史的同时，更强调两德统一带来的自由、解放与民主。

First to come to Germany were the members of the European Union, second were the Germans who have experienced the perils of extreme nationalism. Officials were not willing to emphasize nationalism, while remembering at the same time the country's history, focusing more instead the freedom brought about by the unification of East and West Germany: Liberation and Democracy.

> 今年的统一纪念日在北部港口城市汉堡举行，口号是“开启新方向”（Opening up new horizons），与过去几年强调“团结”的主题不一样，德国要找到新方向。

This year's anniversary was held in the northern port of Hamburg City, having the slogan "Opening up new horizons". For the past several years, it has emphasized varying themes of "unity", and that Germany will find a new direction.

> 德国总理朔尔茨就说，德东地区是未来德国经济增长潜力最大的地方，或许就是今年两德统一纪念的“新方向”：吸引高科技投资落地德东，消弭两地发展差距。

German Prime Minister SCHOLZ has said that East Germany will in the future be the economy with the largest growth potential in Germany. This is perhaps the “New Direction” that was being spoken of in this year’s commemoration of the unification of East and West Germany, where absorption of high-tech investments by East Germany shall eliminate the developmental gap between the two.

> 新方向意味着国家出现了危机，因此才需要新的目标，凝聚国民。

What this new direction means for Germany is that due to the crisis, it has become necessary to have a new objective: a united people.   

> 经济危机是德国当前面对的重大难关，连续三季的经济萎缩，在经济学上已陷入衰退。这和俄乌战争造成的能源危机，以及德国产业发展方向有关。

The economic crisis is Germany's most difficult problem to confront, linked to the shrinking of the economy, and the economic recession. This and the war between Russia and Ukraine have created the energy crisis, which has affected Germany's industrial development direction.

> 另一个危机则出现在国家认同、向心力方面。近年来德国极右政党另类选择党迅速崛起，

Another problem that has come up is the issue about unity and national agreement. In recent years, Germany's extreme right has risen rapidly to become an alternative political party,

> 占据议会近10%的议席，背后就有着东、西德统一后发展不均、人口流失等等的问题。

occupying close to 10% membership in parliament. Backing it is the East, who after unification with the West, has not developed as much, having problems due to the outflow of man-power, etc.  

> 根据今年公营电视台德国电视1台公布的民调，在德东地区的受访者当中，有43%认为自己是二等公民，同时有49%认为不是。

Based on this year's polls, as broadcasted by Germany's public TV channel 1, among the respondents in East Germany, 43% believe that they are 2nd class citizens, while at the same time, 49% believe themselves to be not so. 

> 尽管情况已较过去10年有所改善，但仍然有相当部分的德东地区民众认为待遇不公。

Although conditions in the past 10 years have markedly improved, there are still quite a number of people who believe that they are not treated fairly in East Germany.
