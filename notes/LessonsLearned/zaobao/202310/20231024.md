HUANG, Bonong: Unmanned vehicles and the scientific community of the future

> 黄伯农

HUANG, Bonong

### SELECT PARTS

> 由于近年人工智能（AI）被视为“工业革命4.0”的核心科技，AI和所衍生的科技包括“神经网络”（neural network）和“超级智慧”（superintelligence）便被认为能拥有谋划、做价值判断、自我学习、自我修复改善和执行行动的能力等。

Because Artificial Intelligence (AI) has in recent years been seen as the core technology of "Industrial Revolution 4.0", AI and its derivative technologies, "neural network" and "superintelligence", have been believed to be applicable in making plans, value judgements, as well as for self-learning, self-improvement and skills-oriented activities, etc.

> AI因此被认为拥有甚至能超越人类智慧的能力和潜能。AI、机械人、自动化系统和无人驾驶装置等，便可被概念化为“非人类行动者”（nonhuman agency）。

AI, therefore, is believed to have the potential and the super human wisdom to do tasks. AI, robots, automated systems, and unmanned driving vehicles, etc., can then be conceptualized as part of the so-called "non-human agency".

> 1950年，英国AI之父图灵（Alan Turing）先提出电算机器会仿效人类思想的说法。

In 1950, Mr TURING, Alan, AI's Father from England, first proposed a calculating machine that can imitate human thought in its manner of speaking.

> 他的主张引起神学界、数学界和哲学界争议批评。

His advocacy has brought about disputes and criticism in the theological, mathematical and philosophical fields. 

> 其中有神学家提出神赋予人类不死灵魂，使人类拥有非人类物种没有的思想能力。因为电算机器没有灵魂，它们便不可能如人类般去思考。

Among those, there is this idea from theologians, who have proposed that non-humans do not have the ability to think as humans do, because human beings have been given by God an undying soul. And because electronic calculating machines do not have a soul, they then cannot think as humans beings do.

> 图灵则认为，被造物会被赋予灵魂，纯粹是造物者神自己的决定，人类只作为被神委派管理世上所有被造物的管家。

TURING believed that this soul can be discarded by machines, whose purity comes from the decisions chosen for them by their creators themselves. Human beings only need to be the stewards of all the machines in this God-created world.
