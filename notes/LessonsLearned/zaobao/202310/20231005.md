> 社论：别让附加险妨碍癌症治疗费降低

Societal Discussion: Don't let adding insurance hinder the lowering of cancer treatment costs

> 未列入癌症药物清单的治疗方案今年4月起不能再向私人综合健保计划（Integrated Shield Plan，简称IP）索赔，到3月底仍在接受治疗的患者有六个月的宽限期，这刚在上周六（9月30日）结束，意味着癌症病患在接下来接受治疗时若因为种种原因必须采用清单以外的药物治疗，所涉及的费用都必须自掏腰包，除非有另外购买附加险。

> 此外，卫生部也为门诊癌症药物和服务定下更严格的索偿顶限。在调整前，多数保险业者的IP在扣除自付额和共同承担额后可提供全额索赔，在调整后，IP索赔额限制在终身健保索赔顶限的五倍，若购买附加险，则索赔额可以多达15倍。

> 两个新措施的出发点都是要遏制保险索赔额进一步攀升，以及药价上涨对保费的影响，然而保险业者因应新措施推出的附加险却可能令卫生部的努力事倍功半。

> 自2021年8月宣布推出癌症药物清单以来，好些药厂已经降低了癌症药物价格，以让药物能列入清单享有津贴等优势，根据卫生部早前透露，药价平均降低三成，一些甚至多达六成。

This August 2021, after announcing the roll-out of the list of Cancer medicines, there are a few good pharmaceutical manufacturers that have already lowered their prices for Cancer medicine, which lets these medicines in the inventory to enjoy a subsidy advantage. Based on an earlier report from the Ministry of Health, the average price of the medicines lowered by 3 times, with some even as much as 6 times. 

> 然而私人医疗机构没有同样的议价能力，同一款药物可能需要支付比公共医疗机构高一倍的价钱，附加险涵盖未列入清单的癌症药物并有更高的索赔顶限，可能助长药厂继续以高昂的价格供应药物给私人医疗机构，而一些医生也可能倾向为病患推荐成本与临床疗效不相称的癌症治疗方案，推高新加坡的整体医疗开支。

However, private medical treatment does not have the same bargaining power. The price of the same medicine may need to be double the cost of medical treatment at the public sector. Adding to the risk are those Cancer medicines that are not yet covered and look for a much higher claims ceiling.  

It is possible that these induce pharmaceutical manufacturers to continue to increase the price of medicines that they provide to the private sector. Meanwhile, some of the physicians can also have the tendency to push for a continuous increase in Singapore's overall medical treatment expenses in terms of patient recommendation costs and measures to treat Cancer that are not yet clinically curable.

> 没有购买附加险的癌症患者下来若无法负担私人诊所或医院的治疗费用而必须转介至公共医疗领域，恐怕会进一步加重公共医疗服务的负担。

> 然而附加险并不是问题的根源。传统上，附加险主要用于抵消自付额和共同保险的部分，如今涵盖范围扩大到癌症治疗所涉及的庞大医药开支，就会出现被滥用的情况。

Paying for insurance is not really the source of the problem. Traditionally, paying for insurance generally reduces the fees that people shoulder and the overall amount paid by insurance companies; however, since insurance coverage has now become much wider, including huge medical expenses to treat Cancer, this mechanism has also become more open for abuse.

> 病人的焦虑很容易被利用，尤其是患癌者，附加险所提供的巨额保障可能让患者为了治病而对医生的建议照单全收，在治疗效果不明确的情况下尝试昂贵治疗。

Patient anxiety is easy to be taken advantage of, especially Cancer patients. Paying for insurance offers a much stronger security that can empower patients to be treated, as well as receive physician recommendations. In addition, while the efficacy of treatment is still not clear, expensive treatment can be tested.

> 政府可以监督私人医疗机构的收费，但是对于医生的治疗建议和病人要选择什么方案就很难干涉。这当中也牵涉到医德的问题。

The government can verify the mechanism used in private treatment to charge fees, but it is still much harder to intervene in medical treatment cases recommended by physicians and whatever management that the patient chooses. These are problems that involve medical ethics.

> 癌症药物清单传达的信息是明确的，就是希望病患和医生使用经临床验证且具有成本效益的治疗方法，虽然附加险可涵盖非成本效益治疗的费用，但需要支付昂贵保费。人们在决定是否购买附加险时，应考虑自己的需求和长期负担能力，毕竟附加险的保费不菲，每年从数百元到上万元不等。在参与IP的国人当中，约三分之二也购买了附加险，这些人或许并不需要附加险所提供的超高额索赔顶限。政府在必要时可能也得管控这些附加险的索赔设计是否合理，保险公司也有责任不要以“诱使”或“恐吓”手段，鼓励人们购买索赔顶限不切实际的附加险。

> 保险公司征收的保费取决于它们的理赔经验，如果索赔额增加了，保险公司自然会提高保费，而支付了更高保费的病患抱着物尽其用的心态，不拒绝昂贵的治疗方案，会进一步推高保险公司的理赔额，造成一场恶性循环。


> 要解决医药费上涨的问题，还需要从多方面下手，政府除了被动应对之外，也应该积极主动，例如推进本地的研发以减少对外国药厂的依赖，并鼓励国人通过健康生活减少患癌风险因素，

To solve rising medicine costs, it is still necessary to start with many points of view. Not including those outside government responsibility, the government should pro-actively take action, such as, for example, pushing for local Research & Development so as to reduce reliance on medicines from foreign countries, encouraging locals to live a healthy lifestyle, which reduces Cancer risk factors, as well as 

> 加强宣导定期体检，提高早期发现率不仅康复的机会较大，也可避免昂贵的治疗费用。

strengthening awareness about regular physical examinations not only to widen the possibility for recovery, but also to bring up the rate of early detection, so that expensive treatment costs can be avoided.
