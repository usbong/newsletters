### KEYPHRASE

> 总理说，从市场角度来看，绿色能源拥有更大的市场就意味着有一定可靠度，但这须要工程上的配合、达成政治协议，以及制定商业安排。

The Prime Minister says that from a market perspective, green energy has a larger market, meaning that it has definite reliability, but this point requires us to cooperate with engineering, reach government agreement, and also create business plans.

> “我们希望从所有来源进口大量的绿色能源，并很高兴收到（阿联酋的）提议。我认为两国将有机会开展绿色能源合作。”

We hope to import large volumes of green energy from all available sources, and we are happy to receive proposals from the United Arab Emirates. I believe that our two nations have this opportunity to develop green energy together.
