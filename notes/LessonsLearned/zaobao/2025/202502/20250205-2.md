It's difficult to avoid getting in contact with chemical substances when doing household chores.

> 皮肤专科医生陈爱霖说，一般上，皮肤因接触到化学物而产生的症状，可能是急性的，也可能是慢性的。急性症状包括皮肤瘙痒、发红、渗出或结痂的水泡等；慢性症状包括皮肤干燥、出现鳞屑、皮肤增厚、裂缝和裂纹，可能导致疼痛。

Dr. CHEN says that, in general, the symptoms produced by getting in contact with chemical substances may either be acute or chronic. Symptoms that are acute include skin itchiness, redness, presence of oozing pus, blisters, scabs, etc. Chronic symptoms include dry skin, scaling, increased thickness in the skin as well as cracks and fissures, which may lead to pain.

> 陈医生建议： 

Dr. CHEN advises:

> ■做家务时尽可能戴手套，避免直接接触化学物。

When doing household chores, wear gloves every time, and avoid direct contact with the chemical substances.

> ■选择适合敏感皮肤(通常不含香料和染料)的洗涤剂产品。

Choose detergent products that are appropriately sensitive to the skin (usually without aroma nor dyes).

> ■经常涂抹皮肤保湿霜，最好在每次洗手后涂抹。 

Always apply moisturizing cream to the skin. The best way is to apply it after every wash of the hands.

> 如果有皮肤炎，建议咨询全科医生或皮肤科医生。如果无法及时就医，出现症状时可尝试使用非处方或外用药膏，如氢化可的松乳膏（hydrocortisone cream）和抗菌乳膏（如皮肤有破损），帮助减轻症状。

If there's dermatitis, she advises that the patient consult a general physician or a dermatologist. If it's not possible to quickly obtain medical help, and the symptoms have already appeared, he can try using over-the-counter creams or those for external use only, like an hydrocortisone cream and an anti-bacterial cream (if the skin is damaged), to help reduce the symptoms.
