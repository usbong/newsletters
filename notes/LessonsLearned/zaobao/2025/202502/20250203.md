> 在大选年，政府的财政预算案通常倾向于维持扩张，今年预计不会例外。除了协助家庭和商家应对生活开销和营业成本上涨的问题，经济师认为，财政刺激措施也有助于新加坡经济应对外部环境的变化，尤其是美国大力实施关税可能带来的冲击。预计2025财年的财政赤字将达27亿元，占国内生产总值的0.4％。

During election year, the government is wont to enlarge the national budget, and this year's budget isn't deemed to be an exception. Other than the issue of providing financial aid to households and growing businesses, economists believe that the government stimulus package for this fiscal year was also made in response to changes in the external environment, particularly in terms of the possible impact that America's vigorous tariff impositions are going to bring. The Singaporean government foresees that it'll reach a deficit of 2.7 billion SGD for the fiscal year 2025, occupying 0.4% of its GDP.

On the 18th of February, Prime Minister Lawrence Wong will be presenting in a meeting the government's annual budget for fiscal year 2025.

> 大华银行环球经济与市场研究部联合副经济师许俊杰，在一份预算案展望的分析报告中指出，预计我国2024财年的总经常收入（operating revenue）将远高于预期，主要是得益于企业所得税和个人所得税的增加。这既源于我国经济增长明显优于预期，也反映了人们的名义收入增长更多。

Joint-Associate Economist XU, Junjie from the United Overseas Bank (UOB) Global Economics and Markets Research has pointed out in a report analyzing the budget that the nation's operating revenue will be much higher than expected, due mainly to the increase in the income tax returns of businesses and individuals. This, he says, is already clear in the growth of the national economy, which is also reflected in the increase in the nominal income of the population.

> 根据官方数据，我国去年经济预计增长4％，优于原本预测的1％至3％；人们的名义收入增长5.8％，优于2023年的2.5％。

According to official data, the national economic budget grew 4% last year, better than the 1% to 3% in the original estimate. Meanwhile, the people's nominal income increased 5.8%, better than the 2.5% of 2023.

## > 去年4月至12月总经常收入近875亿元

## From April to December of last year, the country's overall income was close to 87.5 billion SGD.

> 统计局的数据显示，我国去年4月至12月的总经常收入接近875亿元，同比增加13.24％，也接近2024财年预算案预计的80.57％。去年预算案公布的全年总经常收入预测是1086亿元。

Data from the Bureau of Statistics show that from April to December of last year, the country's overall income was close to 87.5 billion SGD, increasing by 13.24% more than the previous year, and approaching 80.57% of the estimated budget for the 2024 fiscal year.

> 考虑到国家发展、交通、内政，以及国防开支可能高于预期，而社会与家庭发展、永续发展与环境、人力，以及政府行政支出比预期低，大华银行估计，我国2024财年可取得50亿元财政盈余，为国内生产总值的0.7％，大幅高于预测的8亿元，或占国内生产总值的0.1％。

Taking into consideration projects geared towards national development, transportation, internal affairs as well national defense, the expenditure may be much higher than expected. On the other hand, expenditures on projects related to community and household development, sustainable development and the environment, human resources as well as administrative expenses may be lower than planned. The UOB reports that it was possible to gain a surplus of 5 billion SGD for the 2024 fiscal year, 0.7% of the GDP and substantially higher than the estimated 800 million, or 0.1% of the GDP.  

> 此外，2023财年的财政赤字有可能减少至29亿元，低于预估的36亿元。

Also, the deficit for fiscal year 2023 may decrease to 2.9 billion SGD, lower than the estimated 3.6 billion SGD.

> 大华银行的报告说：“在财政更良好的情况下，我们预计2025财年预算案将维持扩张，并预测2025财年的财政赤字为27亿元，为国内生产总值的0.4％。”

The UOB reports, "Under better conditions, we'd be expected to continue to make the 2025 fiscal budget larger; however, we predict that for 2025 the deficit will be 2.7 billion SGD, or 0.4% of the GDP."

> 报告也认为，若美国大幅加征关税，政府提供的财政刺激，将有助本地经济应对外部需求放缓的影响。

The report also indicates that if the U.S. substantially imposes more tariffs, the government will offer a financial stimulus package to help the economy and respond to the impact of slowing overseas demand.

## > 分析：选民关注生活费 政府或提供更多现金和邻里购物券

## Analysis: Voters focus on living expenses, the government provides more cash and Community Development Council (CDC) vouchers

> 大华银行认为，政府有可能在2025财年预算案中，为每户家庭额外提供至少600元社区发展理事会邻里购物券（CDC voucher）；为低收入家庭提供一次过的生活费现金资助；把原本半年发放一次的婴儿花红现金奖励（Baby Bonus Cash Gift）改为每季发放，并提供更多奖励措施，以吸引人工智能、金融和绿色转型等关键增长领域的投资，为国人创造更多优质就业机会。

UOB believes that under the National Budget for Fiscal Year 2025, the government will provide, in addition to the amount alloted for each household, CDC vouchers, which are worth at least 600 SGD. For low-income households, the government is providing a one-time cash assistance for their living expenses. By setting the original biannual, one-time "Baby Bonus Cash Gifts" to be quarterly, providing more incentives-based measures, attracting the use of Artificial Intelligence, investing in growth regions where key financial and green technologies can be transformative, the nation can create better business opportunities for the people.

> 马来亚银行经济师李顺荣接受《联合早报》的访问时预测，政府将为家庭和企业提供慷慨的支持，以帮助减轻高昂的生活费和经营成本。

When Maybank Economist Lee, Hsien Loong (LI, Shunrong) was interviewed by Zaobao news, he noted that the government will be providing generous financial assistance to households and businesses to help reduce expenses due to the high standard of living as well as those incurred from business operations.

> 他说：“考虑到生活费是选民关注的重点，我们预计政府将提供更多现金和邻里购物券，并可能为更大额的开销，如医疗保健、儿童照护和教育，推出更多补贴。”

He said, "Taking into consideration the living expenses that voters are keen on, we expect that the government will likely provide more cash and CDC vouchers to spur greater spending on things like medical insurance, child care and education, thereby pushing for more subsidies from the government."

> 由于税收超出预期，李顺荣认为，政府可能会推出个人和企业税收减免措施。此外，外籍工作准证审批的灵活性预计将受到企业欢迎，帮助缓解劳动力短缺问题。

Because income tax returns exceeded our expectations, Mr. Lee, Hsien Loong believes that the government can now push for individual and business tax relief measures. Also, he says that approving flexible working passes for foreign citizens will be a welcome improvement for businesses as a way to alleviate the problem of insufficient man-power.

> 他还预测，政府将公布更多与柔佛—新加坡经济特区援助配套的细节，助力新加坡企业和全球跨国公司拓展至柔新特区。有关奖励措施可能会聚焦于把柔新特区打造为新马两地的综合投资目的地。

He also foresees that the government will announce more details on the Johor-Singapore economic zone assistance program to help Singaporeans and growing international businesses expand further to this special economic zone. Regarding incentives-based measures, the meeting will likely focus on the new Malaysia-Singapore special economic zone which is aimed to be a new comprehensive investment destination. 

> 李顺荣说：“2025财年预算案是现任政府五年任期的最后一份预算案，我们认为政府将动用大部分累积盈余，为国人提供一份慷慨的‘大选年预算案’（Election Budget）。”

Mr. Lee, Hsien Loong says, "The 2025 Fiscal Year Budget is the plan until the end of the five-year term of the present administration. We believe that the government will use a great part of the surplus accumulated by the preceding administration to provide the people a generous 'Election Budget.'"

## > 研究：维持或增加直接转移更多出于政治考量

## Research: Political considerations on whether to maintain or to increase direct financial aid transfers

> 信息服务公司Fitch Solutions旗下研究机构BMI预测，直接转移给每户家庭将是2025财年预算案的重点。

News Service Provider Fitch Solutions, along with BMI, its affiliated research institution, predicts that direct financial aid transfers given to each household is the crux of the 2025 Fiscal Year Budget.

> 机构指出，尽管我国的通货膨胀已有所缓解，但与冠病疫情前相比，整体物价水平已经上涨超过16％。“新加坡经济在2024年的表现，优于大多数先进经济体，增长了4％，失业率为1.9％。通胀放缓应当改善了人们的实际收入。因此理论上，政府可以减少资助。”

The research institution points out, even with alleviation measures against currency inflation, comparing the situation prior to the Corona virus, overall commodity prices have already gone higher than 16%. Still, "Singapore's Economy in 2024 showed that it was better than many advanced economies, growing 4%, with an unemployment rate of 1.9%. The inflation alleviation measure already improved people's actual income, such that, theoretically, the government can decrease its financial assistance fund."

> 因此，BMI认为，维持或增加直接转移措施，可能更多反映的是政治考虑，而非经济需求。即便如此，BMI说：“财政管理失误的风险仍然偏低。”

BMI believes that maintaining or increasing direct financial aid transfers can reflect more the government's political considerations, and not economic demand. Even so, BMI said, "The risk of mismanagement is still low."
