> 在新加坡，每天约有23人死于心血管疾病，包括心脏病和中风。根据新加坡心脏基金会的数据显示，2023年的2万6885总死亡人数中，共有8311因心血管疾病去世，占总死亡率30.9%，其中缺血性心脏病（Ischaemic heart disease）占19.7%。2月11日，本地艺人林益民因缺血性心脏病突然离世，再次引起人们对这个心血管疾病的关注。

In Singapore, there are about 23 people who die everyday from cardiovascular diseases. These include heart diseases and stroke. Data from the Singapore Heart Foundation show that among the 26,885 total mortalities in 2023, a total of 8,311 died due to cardiovascular diseases, occupying a total of 30.9%. Within this, ischaemic heart disease occupies 19.7%. Singaporean performer LIN, Yimin's sudden passing in February 11 due to ischaemic heart disease brought again people's attention to cardiovascular diseases.

> 当冠状动脉内的斑块沉积，即动脉粥样硬化，导致部分或完全阻塞，心肌供血受阻而无法获得足够氧气，就会发生心肌缺血。如果斑块破裂，可造成心脏病发作。

When plaque deposits build up in the coronary artery, which is known as "atherosclerosis," it leads to a partial or complete blockage in the flow of the blood. When the heart and the blood are obstructed, and there's no way to get enough oxygen, myocardial ischaemia can occur. If the plaque ruptures, it can produce heart attack.

## There are several risk factors

> 缺血性心脏病的并发症，包括心肌梗死、缺血性心肌病和心源性猝死。劳力性心绞痛是缺血性心脏病的典型症状，但患者可能具有非典型症状，也可能不会出现任何体征或症状。当发生心肌缺血时，最常见的体征或症状是胸闷或胸痛，通常出现在身体的左侧（一般称为心绞痛）。可引起心肌缺血的疾病包括：

Complications of myocardial heart disease include myocardial infarction, ischaemic heart disease and sudden cardiac arrest. Exertional angina is a common symptom of ischaemic heart disease. However, patients may have none of the common symptoms, and may not manifest any physical sign or symptom at all. When ischaemic heart disease occurs, the most frequently observed physical sign or symptom is the tightening of the chest or chest pain. It usually occurs on the left side of the body (in general, this is called "angina pectoris"). The factors that can cause myocardial diseases include:

> 一、动脉粥样硬化：大部分由胆固醇组成的斑块堆积在动脉壁上，阻碍血液流动。这是心肌缺血常见因素。 

1. Atherosclerosis: The great majority of plaques that have formed due to cholesterol are located in the artery wall, obstructing the flow of the blood. This is the most frequently observed cause of myocardial diseases.

> 二、血凝块：动脉粥样硬化中形成的斑块可能破裂，造成血凝块。血凝块可能阻塞动脉，并形成突发严重心肌缺血，进而导致心脏病发作。

2. Blood clotting: In the process of atherosclerosis, the plaque that has formed can rupture, creating blood clots. This can block the artery and produce severe myocardial ischema, which can further lead to heart attack.

> 三、冠状动脉痉挛：动脉壁肌肉的这种暂时性绷紧，可能短暂地减少，甚至阻止血液流向部分心肌。

3. Coronary Artery Spasm: This type of temporary tightening of the arterial wall muscles can briefly decrease blood flow to the myocardium until it stops the flow of the blood altogether.

## > 与心肌缺血相关的胸部疼痛，可由以下因素引发：

## The following causes can produce chest pain that is linked to myocardial disease:

>    体力消耗；

Physical exertion;

>    情绪压力；

Emotional stress;

>    低温；

Low temperature;

>    暴饮暴食。

Binge eating and drinking.

## > 其他风险因素包括：

## Other risk factors include:

>    抽烟和长期接触二手烟；

Smoking and long exposure to second-hand smoke;

>    糖尿病；

Diabetes;

>    高血压；

High blood pressure;

>    “坏”胆固醇（LDL）水平高；

High level of "Bad" cholesterol;

>    甘油三酯水平高；

High level of Triglyceride;

>    肥胖症；

Obesity;

>    缺乏身体活动。

Lack of physical exercise.
