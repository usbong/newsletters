> 不开刀不打针 五招缓解退化性关节炎

Not by surgery nor by injection, five ways to relieve Osteoarthritis

> 人体的膝关节在我们的日常生活中发挥着至关重要的作用。它连接骨骼结构，让我们能灵活地运动，并在活动中起到保护骨组织的作用。然而，一旦患上关节炎，那种酸胀、疼痛、僵硬的感觉让人难以承受，日常生活也因此大受影响。

Our knees have an important role in our everyday life. The bone structure they are linked to lets us perform exercises flexibly and protects us as we do our daily tasks. Still, once we've developed arthritis, it's difficult to simply accept the feeling of pain and stiffness that come along with it, and which greatly affects our everyday life. 

> 为何会患退化性关节炎？

How does a person develop Osteoarthritis?

> 膝关节表面有一层软骨，主要功能是润滑关节、缓冲冲击、减少摩擦并保护关节。随着年龄增长、过度使用或受到外伤，软骨表面可能变得粗糙，从而引发不适的摩擦感，加上骨滑膜神经密布，这种情况往往伴随着疼痛和发炎，导致膝关节炎（Osteoarthritis，简称OA），也被称为退化性或变性关节炎，是一种常见的磨损性疾病。

The surface of the knee has a layer of cartilage, a soft bone whose main function is to lubricate the joints, ease impact, decrease friction and protect the joints. Along with the increase in a person's age, when the cartilage is used excessively or injured from outside, its surface can become crude, bringing in discomfort and the feeling of friction. This type of situation often causes pain and inflammation, leading to Osteoarthritis (OA), which can also be called "degenerative" or "degenerative joint inflammation" and is often regarded as a wear and tear disease. 

> 医学数据显示，膝关节通常在40岁后开始退化。在65岁及以上的成年人中，约35%的人因为患上退化性关节炎，造成行走不便或上下楼梯困难。高级骨科外科顾问韩富财医生指出，在本地，膝关节炎患者占人口的4.7%至11%，平均年龄大约在59岁以上。因此，日常生活中对膝关节炎的预防与保健尤为关键。

Medical data show that the joints of the knees usually begin to deteriorate after 40 years old. By 65 years old and up, about 35% of adults develop difficulty in walking or going up and down the stairs due to Osteoarthritis. As Dr. HAN, Fucai, a Senior Consultant in Orthopedic Surgery, has pointed out, in Singapore, patients with knee arthritis occupy 4.7% to 11% of the population and have an average age of about over 59 years old. Therefore, prevention against knee arthritis and its corresponding care are vital in our daily life.

## Development of Osteoarthritis

> 由于退化性关节炎属于磨损性疾病，首要症状是疼痛。如果不及时干预疼痛症状的发作，其症状通常随着病情的进展逐步加重，以下是主要发展阶段及相应症状：

Because Osteoarthritis is linked to wear and tear, its first symptom is pain. If the pain cannot be promptly addressed, other symptoms will usually follow suit as it continues to worsen. Below are the main stages in the development of Osteoarthritis and the symptoms related to it.

> 初期：膝关节前部或两侧出现疼痛；上下楼梯、从坐姿起身或下跪时感到疼痛。

Initial Stage: Pain manifests itself in front of the knee joint or at both its sides; Pain is felt when going up and down the stairs, standing up from a sitting position, or kneeling down.

> 中期：早晨醒来或长时间保持同一姿势后，膝盖僵硬不适；膝关节肿胀，弯曲和伸直时伴有磨削感；坐时起立困难，步态不稳。

Mid-stage: Waking up in the morning, or after maintaining the same posture for a long time, the knees stiffen and become uncomfortable. The joints in the knees swell, and a grinding sensation is felt when bending and stretching; While seated, it's difficult to stand up, and there's instability when walking.

> 后期：膝关节膨大变形，甚至出现弯曲畸形；膝关节周围的肌肉减少；步行无力，平地行走也感到吃力。 

Later stage: The joints in the knees have become swollen, even appearing to be bent; the skin around the knee joints decreases; the patient cannot walk, even walking on a flat surface takes effort.

Five big ways to help relieve arthritis

> 值得一提的是，膝关节软骨组织没有任何神经结构，因此无法在第一时间察觉软骨受损或退化，一旦发生问题便难以逆转。

One thing worth mentioning is that there are no nerve structures that form the cartilage of the knee joints, so that there's no way for a person to become aware the first time around that his cartilage has been damaged or is deteriorating, and once the problem manifests itself, it's already difficult to reverse it. 

> 目前，除注射治疗或手术外，退化性关节炎的有效治疗方法较为有限。

Aside from injection or surgery, there are limitations in the efficacy of current treatment methods to address Osteoarthritis.

> 以下五个保健贴士，帮你在日常生活中轻松缓解关节不适：

The following are five ways that would help ease joint discomfort in your daily living:

## > 1、适量运动

## 1. Moderate exercise

> 很多人误以为运动会加速膝软骨的磨损，但实际上，适量运动能够增强关节周围的肌肉，从而提高关节的稳定性。尤其是低冲击力的运动，如快走、游泳、太极、瑜伽等伸展运动，不仅有助于保持关节灵活性，还能缓解日常活动对膝关节的负重和冲击。

Many people think that exercise accelerates the wear and tear of the knee cartilage, but actually, moderate exercise can strengthen the muscles around the joints, improving the stability of the joint. In particular, low contact sports, like running, swimming, Taiqi, and Yoga, among others, not only help maintain joint flexibility, but can also ease the heavy impact dealt onto the joints of the knees when performing our everyday activities.

## > 2、摄取含抗炎成分的食物

## 2. Eating food with anti-inflammatory ingredients

> 在日常饮食中，应多摄入深色绿叶蔬菜、樱桃、鲑鱼、奥米加-3、全谷物，以及豆类等食物。这些食物含有抗氧化剂和多酚等保护性化合物，有助于消炎。

During everyday meals, eat dark and green leafy vegetables, cherries, salmon, omega-3, whole grains, as well as legumes, among other foods. These have anti-oxidants and polyphenols, compounds that protect and help us against inflammation. 

## > 3、补充关键辅助成分

## 3. Ingredients that provide key supplements  

> 在膝关节保养及改善退化性关节炎的过程中，除了通过日常饮食摄入含抗炎成分的食物外，还可通过保健品摄取一些关键成分，以缓解关节不适并维持关节灵活度。例如，以下是其中的重要成分：

In caring for our knee joints and relieving Osteoarthritis, aside from the daily consumption of food with anti-inflammatory ingredients, we can also eat healthy products that have several key substances to ease the discomfort in the joints and maintain their flexibility. Among these are the following important substances:

> 姜黄素：目前许多研究表明姜黄素中的活性化合物，具有抗炎、抗氧化等的作用，有助于舒缓关节疼痛，是改善退化性关节炎少不了的抗发炎成分。

Circumin: There are currently several researches that show that the active compounds found in circumin have anti-inflammatory, anti-oxidant, etc. effects that can help soothe joint pain. It's an anti-inflammatory substance that is not scarce and helps against Osteoarthritis.

> 二型胶原蛋白（UC-II）：过去，氨糖（Glucosamine）和甲基磺酰甲烷（MSM）被认为是保持关节灵活行动的辅助成分。然而，近年来的研究表明，二型胶原蛋白（Undenatured Collagen Type II，简称UC-II），对缓解关节的冲击、提升关节舒适度、强化关节保护以及延缓软骨退化具有双倍的功效，成了维持关节健康的新焦点。 

Undenatured Collagen Type II (UC-II): Since a long time ago, Glucosamine and Methylsulfonylmethane (MSM) have been considered to be supplementary substances that help keep the joints flexible. Recent research has further shown that UC-II relieves impact to the joints, producing comfort in the joints, protecting them as well as easing cartilage deterioration with twice the efficacy, thereby becoming a new focal point in the maintenance and care of the joints.

## > 4、穿合适的鞋子

## 4. Wear appropriate footwear

> 选择鞋底柔软、能够良好支撑足弓的鞋子十分重要。这类鞋子可以均匀分散体重，从而减轻膝关节承受的压力，减少长期负重对关节的损伤。

It's important to choose footwear with a flexible bottom that also has good arc support. This type of shoes can evenly disperse body weight, lighten the pressure received by the joints of the knees and decrease the injury to the joints caused by carrying a heavy load for a long time. 

## > 5、控制体重

## 5. Control body weight

> 体重过高会增加膝关节的负担，加剧活动时的磨损。因此，将体重控制在18.5至22.9kg/m²的健康范围内，能有效减轻关节的压力和疼痛，也能延缓病情的发展，尤其对舒缓急性疼痛更有帮助。

A heavy body weight can increase the load given to the knee joints, adding to their wear and tear when performing our daily activities. Controlling body weight within the healthy Body Mass Index (BMI) range of 18.5 up to 22.9kg/m² can effectively decrease the pressure to the joints as well as the pain, and can delay the development of diseases, helping in particular relieve acute pain.
