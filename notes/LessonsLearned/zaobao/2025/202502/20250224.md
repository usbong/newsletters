> 取蒜头汁滴鼻腔抗炎，以及用蒜头来按摩涌泉穴排脓，是据称能帮助舒缓鼻窦炎症状的民间疗法。《活得好》请庆德堂的廖俊源医师解析这两种做法是否有医学根据。

Putting a drop of garlic extract into the nasal cavity provides anti-inflammatory effects, while using garlic to massage the Yongquan acupuncture point at the bottom of the feet are said to be folk remedies that help relieve inflammation in the sinus. "Live Well" asked Dr. LIAO, Junyuan of Qing De Tang to explain whether or not these two types of treatments have any medical basis.

> 廖俊源医师说，一些人认为大蒜（蒜头）有抗菌抗炎的作用，取汁滴入鼻腔中，能够帮助清理鼻腔内的积脓，缓解炎症。然而，大蒜汁含有浓度较高的大蒜素，刺激性较强，直接滴入鼻腔，可能引发鼻腔不适、灼热感，甚至导致鼻腔黏膜受损。

Dr. LIU, Junyuan says that some people believe that garlic has anti-bacterial and anti-inflammatory effects. Putting a drop of its extract into the nasal cavity can be enough to help clear it from pus that have accumulated inside, hence providing relief from inflammation. Still, garlic extracts have a relatively high level of concentration and are strong stimulants, such that directly dropping the extract into the nasal cavity can cause discomfort, a burning kind of sensation that may even lead to damage to the mucus membrane inside the nose.

> 此外，廖医师说，位于脚底的涌泉穴，是人体的一个重要腧穴。按摩这穴位，理论上可以促进气血循环、调节身体免疫功能，但没有充分的临床研究证明用大蒜按摩涌泉穴能够有效排脓，进而治疗鼻窦炎。这方法无副作用，如想尝试，是无妨，然而，要有心理准备，这种外部刺激的效果有限。

Aside from this, Dr. LIU says, the Yongquan acupuncture point at the bottom of the feet is a vital point. Theoretically, massaging it can promote blood circulation and adjust the body's immune system; however, there's not enough medical evidence saying that massaging it with garlic is effective in clearing nasal pus, and that this can even be used to treat inflammation in the sinus. Nevertheless, if you're thinking about trying it out, this method doesn't have side effects and it's not harmful. However, the person must still be prepared mentally, because the benefits of this type of external stimulation are limited.
