> 一些科研也对饮醋后人体微小血管血流速度及血液成分的变化进行了研究，发现醋酸对降低血浆甘油三酯、总胆固醇及低密度脂蛋白具有一定的作用，使血浆粘度下降、血液流动性得到改善。

Several scientific research works that studied changes in the blood composition as well as the speed of blood circulation in the body's blood vessels after drinking vinegar have found that the effects of vinegar include lowering the triglycerides in the blood, affecting the body's total cholesterol and low-density lipoprotein, bringing down blood viscosity, and improving blood circulation.

> 网络流传，在200毫升的清水或豆浆中，加入1汤匙醋（约15毫升）搅拌均勻，再加入1茶匙蜂蜜调味饮用，以帮助降脂肪。

According to the Internet, adding a spoon of vinegar (about 15mL) to 200mL of clean water or soy sauce, stirring it well, and then adding a teaspoon of honey to adjust the taste for drinking can help lower body fat. 

> 对此，林医师说，将醋加入水中是可行的，但不建议加到豆浆中，因为豆浆含有丰富的蛋白质，混合酸性的醋，豆浆中的蛋白质会凝固成块，影响口感，也引起消化不良。

With regard to this, Dr. LIN says that adding vinegar to water may be plausible, but he wouldn't recommend adding it to soy sauce, because soy sauce already has an abundant amount of protein, so that by mixing vinegar, which is something acidic, to soy sauce, the protein in the soy sauce can solidify, affecting the person's sense of taste, and also causing indigestion.
