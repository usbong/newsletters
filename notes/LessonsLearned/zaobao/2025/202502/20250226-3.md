Dr. HE, Linlong, a traditional Chinese medicine doctor from the Good Doctor Tampines Branch 1, says that from the point of view of Chinese medicine, frequent drinking of coffee or tea can affect the behavior of the stomach, and it's necessary to achieve a balance between the person's own body and the hot or cold food.

> <b>咖啡茶不宜搭配什么食物</b>

<b>With which foods would coffee and tea not go well together?</b>

> ■辛辣食物：中医认为辛辣食物性属热，可加重体内燥热。咖啡和茶本身有温热或寒凉特性，配合辛辣食物可导致内热上火、喉咙干燥等不适。

■ Spicy food: In traditional Chinese medicine, it's believed that hot and spicy food can increase the hotness and dryness inside the body. When the coffee or tea is especially warm or cold, combining this with spicy food can lead to internal inflammation and dry throat, among other discomforts.

> ■油腻食物：油腻的食物容易加重脾胃负担，而咖啡和茶可能影响胃的消化功能。如果同时摄入油腻食物，易导致脾胃不和、消化不良。

■ Oily food: Oily food can easily increase the burden that the stomach has to take, while coffee and tea can affect the stomach's digestion. If both are taken at the same time, this can easily lead to stomach problems, like indigestion.

> ■冷食和寒凉性食物：特别是喝茶（尤其是凉茶）时，如果搭配寒凉食物，如生冷瓜果或冷饮，会进一步伤及脾胃，导致胃寒或脾胃虚弱症状。

■ Cold food: When drinking tea (especially cold tea), if this is matched with cold food, like cold melon or some kind of fruit drink, it can be a step towards harming the stomach, which leads to symptoms related to a cold or weak stomach.

> ■酸性食物：酸性食物，如柠檬、番茄等可能与咖啡中的成分相互作用，刺激胃酸分泌，容易引起胃部不适或加重反酸等症状。

■ Sour food: Sour food, like lemon, tomato, among others may interact with the components in the coffee, stimulating stomach acidity, and easily causing stomach problems or acid reflux symptoms.

<b>With which foods would coffee and tea go well together?</b>

> ■温和的食物： 咖啡和茶可能导致胃部不适，因此宜搭配温和、易消化的食物，如米粥、面食等。这些食物能养胃、护胃，缓解可能产生的不适。　　

■ Warm food: Coffee and tea can lead to stomach problems, hence food that is warm and easy-to-digest, like congee and noodles, among others can nourish and protect the stomach, as well as reduce possible discomfort.

> ■补气养血的食物：有的茶叶偏寒性，容易伤脾胃气，适合搭配一些养血的食物，如枸杞、红枣、龙眼等；咖啡则容易耗气，适合搭配山药等养气食物。

■ Food that revitalizes: There are tea drinks that are cold and can easily harm the stomach, hence they're suitable with some foods, like berries, dates and longans; coffee easily consumes energy, and is therefore suitable with foods like Chinese yam.

> ■性质平和的失误： 建议搭配性质平和的蔬果，如苹果、梨，或清淡的蔬菜，如菠菜等，能帮助平衡体内燥热或寒凉，有助促进消化。

■ Problems in the body's equilibrium: Vegetables and fruits like apples, pears or light vegetables such as spinach, among others can help balance the hotness or coldness inside the body, thereby helping promote digestion.
