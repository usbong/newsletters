An overweight life is shorter?

> 我们普遍认为体重超标的人寿命会更短，然而，英国医学刊物最近发表的一项研究显示，体能水平可能比体重更能预测寿命。研究人员审查近40万人的数据后发现，体能不佳会使早逝的风险增加一倍以上。

We commonly believe that the lifespan of people who are overweight is shorter. However, a recent publication from a British Medical Journal presented a research finding that showed that fitness level can predict lifespan much better than body weight. The researchers studied the data of 400,000 people and found that poor fitness can increase the risk of early mortality by over two times.

> Arden糖尿病与内分泌学诊所内分泌科医生黄振明接受《活得好》访问时说，上述研究根据人们在体能测试，如跑步机或骑脚踏车耐力测试中的表现，将他们分为体能好或体能不好。结果显示，超重甚至肥胖，但被归类为“体能好”的人，死亡率与体重正常的健康人相似。然而体重正常但体能不良的人，早逝的风险明显增加。

During the interview with Dr. HUANG, Zhenming, Endocrinologist at the Arden Diabetes and Endocrinology Clinic, he said that according to the research study, a person can be classified as either physically fit or not based on fitness tests, such as treadmill or bicycle endurance tests. Results show that people who are overweight, even obese, but can be classified to be physically fit, have a similar mortality rate as healthy people with normal body weight. Still, the risk of early mortality for people with normal body weight but are not physically fit is evidently higher.

> 黄医生指出，多年来，公共卫生指南一直将减肥（和体重相关）作为降低疾病风险的关键因素。但该研究结果显示，无论体型如何，保持活跃可帮助挽救生命。研究者认为，通过定期体育锻炼来保持体能，可能是一种更有效、更可行的策略。 

Dr. HUANG points out that for many years, public health guidelines have been promoting continuously weight loss (in relation to the Body Mass Index (BMI)) as the key factor in reducing the risk of disease. However, results of the said research reveal that regardless of body size, staying active can help save lives. Researchers believe that fitness can be maintained through regular physical training, which is possibly more effective, and a more feasible regimen.

> 黄医生说：“参考上述研究，我认为最好的方法是告诉人们，不要只关注减肥，还要保持生活活跃。我建议成年人每周至少进行150分钟中等强度的体育活动，包括有氧运动，如快走；强化肌肉的运动，包括阻力带运动或重量训练，以及生活方式的活动，如洗车、爬楼梯。”

Dr. HUANG says, "Based on the research, I believe that the best thing to do is to tell people not to only focus on reducing body weight, but to also maintain an active lifestyle. I recommend adults to do at least 150 minutes of moderate physical exercise every week, which includes aerobic exercises, such as brisk walking, muscle strengthening exercises, which include resistance band exercises or weight training, as well as an active lifestyle, such as washing the car and climbing the stairs."
