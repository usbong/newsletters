> 骨质疏松是种常见的退行性骨骼疾病，庆德堂的盧正嘉医师接受《活得好》访问时说，中医认为，骨骼的健康与肾气、脾胃功能、气血充足密切相关，一旦出现问题，骨骼就容易变得脆弱，增加骨折的风险。

Osteoporosis is a type of degenerative bone disease that is quite prevalent. When Dr. LU, Zhengjia of Qing De Tang Clinic was interviewed for "Live Well," he said that from the point of view of traditional Chinese medicine, the health of the bones and the kidneys, the function of the stomach and the amount of blood that is currently available are all closely linked with each other. Once a problem occurs, the bones can easily weaken, increasing the danger of osteoporosis, or the breaking of the bones. 

> 盧正嘉医师解析说，骨骼的生长和修复主要依赖于肾气的充盈。中医有“肾主骨，骨生髓”的说法，意思是肾的精气能够滋养骨骼，使其变得坚韧强壮。当肾气不足时，骨骼就会失去支撑，变得松软脆弱。

Dr. LU, Zhengjia explains that the growth of the bones and their repair are mainly dependent on the kidneys. Chinese medicine has a saying, "The kidneys are the masters of the bones, while bone marrows come from the bones," meaning that healthy kidneys can be enough to nourish the bones, making them hard and strong. When the blood in the kidneys isn't enough, the bones can fail to get the support they need, making them soft and weak. 

> 肾虚可分为肾阳虚和肾阴虚。肾阳虚是因阳气不足，无法提供足够的能量和养分，骨骼变得无力；肾阴虚则是因体内的阴液不足，骨髓得不到滋养，导致骨质流失加速。 

Kidney deficiency can be divided into positive and negative deficiencies. A positive kidney deficiency occurs when there's not enough positive energy in the blood to provide nourishment to the bones, making them weak. A negative kidney deficiency occurs when there's not enough negative energy in the fluid inside the body, such that the bones cannot get nourishment, accelerating bone loss.

> 正气不足也是引致骨质疏松的原因之一。人体的正气就像一道天然屏障，能抵御外邪的侵袭。如果正气不足，外界的邪气，如寒邪、湿邪或风邪容易趁虚而入，影响气血运行，使骨骼得不到充分的滋养，时间久了，骨质就会逐渐疏松，出现疼痛或活动受限的情况。

Not having enough of the necessary energy in the blood is one of the causes of osteoporosis. The right amount of energy in the human body is like a natural barrier that can decrease foreign intruders. If the correct amount of energy isn't enough, the intruders from outside, such as the cold, the heat or the wind can easily come in, affecting the circulation of the blood, which then causes the bones to have only meager nourishment. After a long while, the bones will gradually degenerate, leading to pain, or some type of unhealthy condition.
