> 一些人原本睡觉不会打鼾，上了年纪后却有这方面的问题。《活得好》请Beyond Medical Group 旗下Aglow ENT诊所的耳鼻喉专科顾问兼医疗总监郭亮医生解析原因。

To begin with, people don't really snore when they sleep, but it does become a problem once they get older. "Live Well" invited Dr. GUO, Liang, the Medical Director and Ear, Nose and Throat (ENT) Consultant of Beyond Medical Group's Aglow Clinic, to explain the causes of snoring.

> 郭亮医生说，随着年龄增长会打鼾的原因包括：

Dr. GUO, Liang says that the causes of snoring as people grow older include:

> ■气道肌肉变弱：肌肉张力丧失，加剧气道组织振动，从而引致打鼾。

■ Weakening of the muscles in the air passageway: Muscle tension is lost, aggravating the vibration in the passageway, which leads to snoring.

> ■鼻塞和结构变化：鼻中隔偏曲（deviated septum）、鼻甲肥大（enlarged turbinates）或慢性鼻窦问题变得更普遍，而限制气流。

■ Nasal congestion and changes in the structure of the nose: Problems such as a deviated septum inside the nose, enlarged turbinates, or a chronic sinus have become even more common, restricting air flow.

> ■饮酒和吸烟：使气道肌肉松弛，引致气道充血，加重打鼾。

Liquor drinking and smoking: Relaxing the muscles in the air passageway leads to congestion, aggravating the snoring.

> 鉴于上述导因，郭医生建议，若有过敏和鼻塞问题，应前去求医，控制好病情，改善气流，预防打鼾。睡前也应避免饮酒和抽烟，以免肌肉过度松弛而致打鼾。

Given the causes mentioned, Dr. GUO recommends that if the person has allergy and nasal problems, he should first seek a medical doctor to manage the illness and improve air flow in order to prevent snoring. Also, before sleeping, he should avoid drinking liquor, smoking and too much muscle relaxation that leads to snoring.
