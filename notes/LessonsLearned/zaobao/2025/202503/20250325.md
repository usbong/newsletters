> 流鼻血是大人小孩中常见的情况，一般无碍，但什么时候应提高警惕，前去看医生？《活得好》请Beyond Medical Group旗下Aglow ENT诊所的耳鼻喉专科顾问兼医疗总监郭亮医生解析。

Nose bleeding is an often seen case among adults and children. While generally unobtrusive, when does it raise an alarm so that the person would have to go see a medical doctor? "Live Well" invited Dr. GUO, Liang, the Ear, Nose and Throat (ENT) consultant and Medical Director of Beyond Medical Group's Aglow ENT Clinic to provide his analysis on the matter. 

> 耳鼻喉专科顾问医生郭亮说，流鼻血，又称鼻出血（epistaxis），指的是鼻腔或鼻咽（nasopharynx，鼻腔内延伸至咽喉后部的区域）出血。这是一种症状，并非疾病。流鼻血表示鼻黏膜受到刺激、创伤或有潜在疾病。

Dr. GUO, Liang says that nose bleeding, which is also called "epistaxis," refers to blood coming out from the nasal cavity and the nasopharynx (the region that extends from within the nasal cavity to the back portion of the throat). This is a type of symptom, not a disease. Nose bleeding shows that the nasal mucosa has been irritated, wounded or has an underlying disease. 

> 郭医生指出，流鼻血通常是属于轻微的，但如果出现以下情况，可能意味较严重病况，需提高警惕，前去看医生，做进一步诊断： 

Dr. GUO pointed out, nose bleeding is usually mild, but if the following conditions are present, it's possible that it could signify that it's a relatively serious type of condition that raises an alarm so that the person would need to go to the medical doctor and take a step closer to diagnosis:

> ■频繁流鼻血，即每周发作一次以上。

■ Frequent nose-bleeding, i.e. occurring more than once every week 

> ■鼻血流入喉咙，并随唾液吐出。

■ The bleeding flows into the throat, and is spitted out with the person's saliva.

> ■流鼻血伴其他症状，如头痛、发烧、头晕、虚弱、呼吸困难、耳朵疼痛等。

■ The nose bleeding is accompanied by other symptoms, such as head pain, fever, dizziness, lethargy, breathing difficulty and ear pain, among others.
