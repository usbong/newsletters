> 若发生汽车追尾事故，后方车子撞击的冲力，可能导致车内人“摇头晃脑”，随后感到颈部不适、僵硬或疼痛。这种伤势被称为“挥鞭伤”（whiplash）。《活得好》请百汇东岸医院物理治疗师埃里克·费尔南多解析挥鞭伤的导因和症状。 

When the rear of a vehicle is hit during an accident, the impact caused by the collision behind can lead to a "jolt" that soon afterward makes the person feel a discomfort, stiffness or aching in his neck. This type of injury is called, "whiplash." "Live Well" invited Eric Fernando, a Physical Therapist at the Baihui Dongan Hospital, to explain the cause as well as the symptoms of whiplash. 

> 挥鞭伤，是指颈部如挥动的鞭子般快速用力地前后移动而导致的损伤。物理治疗师埃里克说，挥鞭伤多数是跌倒或运动损伤所致，但最常见的导因是车祸，尤其是追尾碰撞。许多病例涉及软组织损伤，而不是骨折。

Whiplash refers to the pain in the portion of the neck where it's been forcibly jerked back and forth like the flailing of a whip, leading to the injury. Eric says that many of the whiplash injuries that he has seen are caused by a fall or due to sports, but most often the cause is due to a vehicular incident, particularly a collision at the rear of the vehicle. Many involve soft tissue injuries, and are not fractures.
