> 与男子气概无关 生病千万别讳疾忌医耽误病情

It has nothing to do with masculinity! Don't hesitate to seek medical attention if you're sick!

> 除非必要，否则不少男性即使生病，特别是有心理健康问题，都不愿意去看医生，因为相较于跟人求助，男性更希望表现出强壮、坚不可摧的男性形象。但患病不是弱者表现，男性应破除“男子气概”的魔咒，积极关爱自己的健康。

Whether it's necessary or not, many men aren't willing to visit a medical doctor, especially if it concerns a problem that is psychologically related, even if they're sick. This is because a man would rather exude more his strength, a male image that cannot be destroyed, than seek help from another person. However, sickness isn't an expression of a person's weakness. A man should break the curse of "masculinity," and provocatively care for his own health.
