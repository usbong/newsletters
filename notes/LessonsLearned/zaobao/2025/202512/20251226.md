> 运动了血糖不降反升？可能顺序不对

Does your blood glucose level go up instead of go down even after exercising? Maybe the order by which you're doing the exercises isn't right

> 不少人一提到控糖，第一反应往往是“该怎么吃”，却忽略了运动方式其实同样关键。有些人甚至纳闷：明明已经去运动了，血糖怎么不降反升？对此，台湾糖尿病卫教师（Diabetes Educator）林冠怡在脸书分享，这样的情况并不罕见，关键往往出在运动的类型与进行顺序。

Not a few people who've been told to control their glucose levels often have as their first reaction: "What should I eat?" But ignoring the way by which the exercises are done is actually equally important. Some people even wonder, <i>I've been exercising already, yet how come my blood glucose level goes up instead of down?</i> With regard to this, Taiwanese Diabetes Educator LIN, Guanyi shares on Facebook that this type of predicament isn't rare. The key, she says, is frequently found in the type of exercise and the order by which these exercises are done.

> 她指出，不同运动对血糖的影响并不一样。像是阻力训练、重量训练，在进行过程中可能刺激身体分泌压力荷尔蒙，导致血糖出现短暂上升。如果运动前血糖本来就偏高，建议不要一开始就做阻力运动，而是先进行10至15分钟的有氧运动，如快走或骑脚踏车，让血糖先慢慢降下来，再转做阻力训练，血糖变化会相对稳定许多。

She points out that different exercises also have varying impact on our blood glucose levels. Resistance training and weight training exercises can stimulate the body to release stress hormones, which leads to a short rise in the blood glucose level of the person. If the blood glucose level was initially high before doing the exercise, she advises people not to begin with resistance training exercises, and instead go first with 10 to 15 minutes of aerobic exercises, like running or cycling, in order to let the person's blood glucose level gradually go down, and then move to doing the resistance training exercises. The changes in the blood glucose level will be more stable. 

> 林冠怡强调，只要愿意活动，对血糖的帮助一定比完全不运动来得好；但若希望血糖更平稳，就需要一点“方法”。除了选对运动顺序，也别忽略运动的补给。她提醒，补充食物不能凭感觉，而应视运动时间与强度来调整，吃太多或太少都可能影响血糖的波动。

Ms. LIN, Guanyi emphasizes that if we're only willing to exercise, the benefits of this to our blood glucose level is a lot better than doing no exercise at all. However, if we want to have a more stable blood glucose level, we need a "method." Other than choosing the order by which we would do the exercises, we shouldn't also ignore our food intake. She reminds us that our food intake shouldn't be based on our mood; rather, it should be adjusted according to the duration and the intensity of our exercise workout. Eating too much or too little can both impact the fluctuations in our blood glucose levels.

> 另外，进行长时间运动时，也要特别留意低血糖的风险。正在使用降糖药物或胰岛素的人，若计划增加运动量，最好先与医生或专业人员讨论，评估是否需要调整用药。运动是控糖的好帮手，只要方式对了，就能动得安心，也能动出健康。

Moreover, when we exercise for long periods of time, we should also keep in mind the risk of hypoglycemia (low blood glucose level). Therefore, it would be best for people, who're currently taking insulin or medicine to lower their blood glucose levels, to first consult with a physician or specialist if they plan to increase the amount of exercise they'll be doing in order to assess whether or not their medicine would need to be adjusted. Exercise is a good way to control our blood glucose levels, and by using the right method, we can do them with peace of mind and also improve our health in the process.
