> 佳节期间，独居长者往往比平日更容易感到孤独。例如，他们可能怀念过去的亲情与社交关系，或是在看到他人与家人团聚时，不自觉将自己与之比较，从而倍感落寞。正因如此，独居长者在节日期间更应关注自身的情绪。

During the holiday season, elderly people who're living alone feel a lot more lonely easily and more frequently besides, as compared to during other times of the year. They may, for instance, long for past familial and social relations, or when they see other people and their families together in groups, they can't help but compare themselves to them. This makes them feel lonely. This is why elderly people who're alone should focus more on their own moods during the holiday season.
