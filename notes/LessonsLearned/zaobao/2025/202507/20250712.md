What is the difference between cauliflower and broccoli? Why do some people who eat a lot of these two varieties of vegetables become bloated? Live Well invited Dr. HUANG, Jingwen, a dietitian from the 365 Cancer Prevention and Education Association to give his analysis.

## MORE

Dr. HUANG, Jingwen said that other than the difference in their colors, and coming from the standpoint of nutrition, the two vegetables have different amounts of vitamins. For example, the amount of vitamins C and K are higher in broccoli than in cauliflower, while vitamins B5 and B6 are higher in cauliflower than in broccoli.

These two kinds of vegetables also have different antioxidants. Broccoli contains lutein and zeaxanthin, while cauliflower contains protocatechuic acid, coumaric acid and vanillic acid.

## --

Dr. HUANG, Jingwen says that the amount of calories in cauliflowers and broccolis are extremely low, and they have high fiber content. When fiber is ingested and enters a person's large intestine, it's digested by the bacteria inside and produce gas. This is why some people who eat a lot of them can really become bloated. 

For those who have concerns, they can first try eating in small quantities, and then observe their body's reaction. If there's no bloating, then they can gradually increase their intake of the vegetables.
