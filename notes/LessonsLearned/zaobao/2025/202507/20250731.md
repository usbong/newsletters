> 前列腺癌是本地男性最常见的癌症之一。根据新加坡癌症登记处2018年至2022年的最新年度报告，每年约新增1503例前列腺癌病例，相当于每天新增4例左右。

Prostate cancer is one of the most common types of cancer among males in Singapore.

> 先进泌尿外科中心泌尿外科顾问医生陈翘业接受《活得好》访问时表示，尽管前列腺癌在早期阶段较易治愈，但许多患者往往到了晚期才被确诊，这成为一大健康隐忧。

When Live Well interviewed Dr. CHEN, Qiaoye of the Advanced Urology Surgery Center, he said that although prostate cancer is easier to cure at the early stages, many patients frequently get diagnosed at the late stages, thus becoming a major health concern. 

> 陈医生指出，早期前列腺癌通常表现为“无症状”，多数男性因自我感觉良好而忽视健康筛查，导致患者往往在出现症状时才被确诊，此时病情已进入晚期。 

Dr. CHEN pointed out, at the early stages, prostate cancer usually shows "no signs or symptoms." Many males feel good about themselves and neglect to undergo medical screening. This leads to patients frequently getting diagnosed only when the symptoms have appeared and when the disease has already entered the late stages.

> 此外，公众对前列腺健康的认知不足，加之文化观念上的排斥，许多人不愿主动讨论这一话题。许多男性低估自身患病风险，或因回避讨论泌尿系统及性功能等敏感问题，导致诊断与治疗延误。

Aside from this, there isn't enough knowledge available to the public about prostate cancer. Along with the cultural view of being ostracized, many people aren't willing to be proactive in discussing this issue. Many males devalue their own health risks, or avoid discussing sensitive issues related to urology and sexual behavior, so that their diagnosis and treatment also get delayed.

> 人口老龄化也是前列腺癌患者增加的重要原因之一。过去人们的预期寿命较短，但随着人均寿命延长，前列腺癌的患病风险也随着显著增加。

An aging population is also one of the main reasons for the increase in the number of prostate cancer patients. In the past, the expected lifespan of people was still relatively short, but along with longer average life spans, the risk of prostate cancer also significantly increases.

> 以下是前列腺癌的常见症状：排尿困难；小便无力；尿血；精液带血；体重意外下降；勃起功能障碍。
