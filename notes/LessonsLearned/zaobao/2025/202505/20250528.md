> 我国监狱系统也面临人口老龄化的问题。随着年长囚犯占比不断上升，他们的高重犯率、严重成瘾问题，以及缺乏社会支持等困境日益凸显。为此，监狱署推出针对年长囚犯的长期管理计划，旨在协助他们顺利重返社会，避免与社会脱节，同时优化牢房设施，保障他们在狱中的安全。

Our national prison system also has the problem of an aging population. Along with the continuous rise in the number of older prisoners among the inmates, their high recidivism rate, severe addiction problems, as well as the lack of support given them by the community, among other challenges, have gained even more attention. It is in this regard that the prison has pushed for a long-term management plan for the older prisoners, and whose main objective is to help them reintegrate back into the community, preventing a disconnect from society, while at the same time enhancing the prison facility and ensuring the safety of the inmates while in prison.

Data from Singapore's National Prison show that in the past five years, the number of prisoners over 65 years old has increased from 327 in 2020 (occupying 4% of the total prison population) to up to 574 in 2024 (occupying 8% of the total).

> 75岁的约翰（化名）2024年入狱，大约三个月后，他的背和胯因睡在地上严重疼痛，膝盖关节也时有风湿的痛感，导致行动不便，经评估后，他搬入了优化辅助生活改造牢房。

75-year old John (not his real name) was incarcerated in 2024. After about three months, his back and hip became severely painful due to sleeping on the floor. His knee joints would at times also have rheumatic pain, leading to difficulty in movement. Upon evaluation, he was transferred to a prison cell that has better living conditions especially for older prisoners like himself that need additional assistance.
