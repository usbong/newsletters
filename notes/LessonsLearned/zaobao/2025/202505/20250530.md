Who would have thought that a humanoid robot can now do things like run a marathon, dance while waving a handkerchief, and even go up the ring to fight?

> 5月25日，在浙江杭州举行的《CMG世界机器人大赛·系列赛》机甲格斗擂台赛，就让外界看到了人形机器人“好斗”的一面。

Last May 25, during the "CMG World Humanoid Competition" held in Hangzhou, Zhejiang, observers witnessed humanoid robots battling it out in what people have called a "good fight."

> 这场擂台赛采积分制，三回合内机器人需凭真功夫抢分。击中对方头部或躯干才算得分——出拳得一分，踢腿得三分，打中四肢不算分。要是摔倒了，不仅扣五分，八秒内爬不起来，该回合就提前结束。

The rules on the ring, according to the competition's point system, say that the humanoid robots need to rely on their true fighting skills to earn points within three rounds. Hitting the opponent's head earns the robot points. It's one point for a punch, while three points for a kick. Hitting the limbs doesn't amount to any point. If the robot falls down, five points are deducted, and if it cannot get up within eight seconds, the round is ended.
