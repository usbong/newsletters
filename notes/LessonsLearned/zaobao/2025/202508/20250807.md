>（旧金山综合电）Meta今年上半年已关闭680万个与诈骗份子有关的WhatsApp账户，并推出新安全功能，进一步强化防诈措施。

(San Francisco News) Meta has already closed down 6.8 million WhatsApp accounts linked to fraud this year. It has also pushed forward a new safety feature to further strengthen anti-fraud measures.

> Meta属下的WhatsApp外部事务主管迪维（Clair Deevy）星期二（8月5日）说，公司团队在犯罪团伙利用这些账户之前，已采取措施识别并封锁账户，其中大部分账户的注册地位于东南亚。

Clair Deevy, the External Relations Officer of WhatsApp, a company under Meta, said on Tuesday (August 5) that their team has already employed measures to identify and block accounts before they're used by criminal organizations. They've also indicated that the registered location of majority of these accounts is Southeast Asia.

> Meta和WhatsApp就与OpenAI合作，查获一起来自柬埔寨的诈骗案。在这起案件中，犯罪分子利用ChatGPT生成含有WhatsApp聊天链接的短信来诱骗受害者，让受害者帮忙“点赞”视频换取报酬、参与传销计划或投资等。

Meta and WhatsApp are working with OpenAI in order to uncover fraud in Cambodia. Among those that have been reported, one is involved with the use by criminals of ChatGPT within WhatsApp to chat and lure victims, so that they'd "Like" videos in exchange for rewards, join in pyramid schemes or make some kind of investment.

> Meta指出，这类骗局都有一个共同点，就是必须先付款，才能拿到所谓的收益或报酬。这些骗局通常由有组织团伙操控，而且形式多样。

Meta pointed out that these types of fraud all have one thing in common, and that is, the target victim must first pay to be able to get the said income or reward. Moreover, the scams are usually controlled by organized gangs and have many and varied forms.

> 对此，Meta推出“安全概览”的新功能，即当陌生人将用户添加到陌生聊天群时，WhatsApp将跳出提示，标注有关群组的信息、识别诈骗的信息，以及快速退出群组的选项，协助用户判断是否要继续留在群组中。

With regard to this, Meta pushed forward a new feature called "Safe Browsing." When a stranger adds an account into a chat group, a prompt on WhatsApp will appear. It'll put a label containing information about the group, identify fraudulent information, as well as add an option to quickly get out of the group. Its goal is to assist users in deciding whether or not to continue to stay in the group.

> 另外，由于骗子可能会通过其他社媒平台与受害者取得联系后，再要求受害者从WhatsApp发送消息，因此Meta目前正在测试新的防诈功能。当用户尝试与陌生用户展开对话时，WhatsApp将提供更多有关对方的信息，帮助用户判断对方的身份，再决定是否继续展开对话。

In addition, since scammers can contact victims through other social media platforms and request the victim to again send information from WhatsApp, Meta is currently working on testing a new preventive feature. When the user tries to make a conversation with a stranger, WhatsApp will provide more information about the other person to help users judge for themselves the identity of the other person, and decide if they would like to continue with the conversation.

> Meta在官网发布的文章写道：“我们都遇到过这种情况：一个你不认识的人试图发信息给你，或把你加入一个群聊，承诺低风险投资或轻松赚钱，或者告诉你有账单逾期未付，但实际上往往都是骗子。”

Meta has officially issued a public statement saying, "We all come across this type of situation: A person you don't recognize tries to send you a message, or adds you to a group, promising low risk investments and easy money, or tells you that your bill is already overdue, but in reality, as is often the case, we find that they're all scams."

> Meta指出，骗子试图利用人们的善意、信任和愿意帮忙的心理，或是担心“若不赶紧转账就会出事”的恐惧心理，趁机实施诈骗。

Meta pointed out that scammers try to use people's good will, trust, the psychology to help willingly, and even worry, which involves the psychological fear that "if I don't transfer the money right now something bad will happen," offering an opportunity that must be seized immediately only to later find that it has led the victim to committing fraud.
