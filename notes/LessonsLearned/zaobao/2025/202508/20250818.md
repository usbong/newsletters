>（亚特兰大讯）一项最新的研究显示，每天只需快走至少15分钟，就能获得显著的健康益处，比起每周完成150分钟中等强度活动，这一目标更容易坚持。

(Atlanta News) Latest research has shown that we only need at least 15 minutes of brisk walking everyday to be able to achieve remarkable results in health. Compared to completing 150 minutes of moderate to strenuous physical exercises, this one goal is a lot easier to maintain.

> 据《美国预防医学杂志》报道，历时约16年追踪近8万5000名受试者。结果显示，平均每天快走至少15分钟的人，过早死亡风险降低近20%；相比之下，即便每天总计慢走逾三小时，风险降幅也仅为4%。

According to the American Journal of Preventive Medicine, in a study that lasted about 16 years, close to 85,000 subjects were tracked, and the results showed that on average the people who brisked walked for at least 15 minutes everyday lowered their risk of dying early by 20%. In comparison, even if the person went over three hours of slowing walking everyday, the reduction in terms of health risk is only 4%.

> 丹佛国家犹太健康中心心血管预防与健康主任弗里曼说：“我们早就知道步行速度与健康结果相关，也就是说，走得越快，效果越好。这很有道理，因为身体状况不佳的人，往往走不快。”

Mr. Freeman, the Director of the Cardiovascular Prevention and Wellness at the National Jewish Health in Denver, said: "We knew early on that there's a relationship between brisk walking and health outcomes. That is to say, the faster one walks, the better the outcome. This makes sense, because a person who's in bad shape oftentimes wouldn't really walk as fast."
