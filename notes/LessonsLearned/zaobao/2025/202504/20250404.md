An upset stomach is often regarded as a disease that disrupts the normal activities of the stomach, manifesting itself mainly in the form of stomach pain or bloating. It's also accompanied by symptoms related to irregular bowel movement such as diarrhea and constipation. "Live Well" invited Dr. YU, Ying, a Chinese Medicine practitioner who specializes in stomach-related diseases at the YU Chinese Medicine Clinic, to offer his advice on how to relieve the symptoms of an upset stomach.

What Dr. YU recommends is for the patient to focus on keeping his stomach warm by using a hot water bag or a warm compress that is placed on his navel for 20 minutes every evening before he sleeps. He says that this technique can best help relieve the stomach pain that is caused by spasms inside the stomach.

> 此外，要适量补充水分，建议分时段均衡喝水；早上、中午、下午及晚上，各时段喝200至300毫升水（约两杯水），避免一次过喝大量水，以免刺激肠道。 

Other than this, he advises the person to have enough quantity of water inside his body by drinking an appropriate amount during each time period, specifically, morning, noon, afternoon and evening. The person should drink 200mL to 300mL of water (about two cups) during every time period, and avoid drinking large amounts of water in one go, so as to prevent himself from upsetting his stomach.
