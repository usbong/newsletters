A new generation of pacemakers doesn't require surgical incisions and lead implants. Since it can be conveniently installed, it reduces the need for invasive surgery. The battery life of this type of pacemaker lasts 18 even up to 30 years, thus reducing the number of times that the battery needs to be replaced. This lowers surgical-related infections as well as the risk of disease.
