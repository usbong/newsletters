> 看标题就吓一跳吧？尤其年纪大的人，肯定吃惊不小。毕竟，谁都喜欢年轻而不喜欢老，谁都中意强壮而不中意衰。不过这不是我说的，是北宋大儒程颐说的。那当然不是随便说的。

The title must have startled you? Not a few older people, in particular, must have been caught by surprise. Anyone likes to be young and not old. Anyone wants to be strong and not weak. But it wasn't me who said this. It was Cheng Yi, the great Confucian Scholar of the Northern Song Dynasty. At the time, it wasn't something that was said only casually.

> 想必很多人知晓的“程门立雪”，讲的就是有人为聆听程颐之说而在门口静立等候，及至出门时“门外雪深一尺”。作为从雪窝子爬出来的东北人，深知哪怕是鹅毛大雪，下一尺厚也起码得两三个钟头。可见程颐的言说有多么大的吸引力。

"Cheng Men Li Xue (Standing at the Door to Find Snow)," which many people would surely know about, spoke of a person who, in order to listen to Cheng Yi, stood quietly at the door entrance of the room where the teacher was until "the snow was one foot deep outside" by the time Cheng Yi went out. As a northeastern person who grew up in the heartland of snow in China, I have a deep understanding of the fear of "Goose Feathers," heavy snowfall that piles to a foot deep after only two or three hours. The words of Cheng Yi can be considered to have had great power in attracting an audience. 

> “不学，便老而衰。”自不待言，学，不止于看书，但程颐所言无疑指的是看书。换个极端说法，不看书，就要看病、看医生。要想不看病、少看病，就要看书、多看书。

"Be old and frail if you don't study." Needless to say, learning doesn't stop at reading books, although what Cheng Yi was undoubtedly referring to was precisely reading. When put in an extreme way, you'll have to go see a doctor in order to have your illness examined if you don't read books. Or, if you want to get examined only very scarcely, then you'll have to read books, actually, plenty of books.
