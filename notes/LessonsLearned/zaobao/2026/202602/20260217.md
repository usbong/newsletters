There are many opportunities to eat, drink and have fun during the year, but what we don't get enough of are the time and space to exercise. Still, despite being always busy, we shouldn't neglect to exercise. ZHU, Kaibing, the Senior Physical Therapist at the 365 Cancer Prevention Education Group, introduces six sitting exercises doable even for beginners, encouraging everyone to be more physically active.

Mr. ZHU reminds us that we shouldn't neglect to exercise even if we're busy. 

> 久坐不动是健康大忌；如果免不了久坐，那至少避免“不动”。希望大家在口头恭祝亲人身体健康之余，也能够身体力行，积极鼓励亲友一起动起来。

Sitting long hours without much movement is a health concern. If you can't avoid sitting for long periods of time, then, at the very least, you should avoid "not moving." His hope is that besides verbally greeting relatives and friends good health, we'd also be physically active, proactively encouraging each other to get up and move about.
