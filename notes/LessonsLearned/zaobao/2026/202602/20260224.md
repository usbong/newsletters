> 团圆带来欢声笑语，也勾起人们的食欲；然而年节一过，体重秤上的数字上扬，难免让人心惊。专家指出，节后“发福”未必只是贪吃所致，更涉及水分滞留、脂肪储存与代谢节律失衡。若以极端节食或爆汗运动“赎罪”，反令荷尔蒙与肠道受扰，引发身体异常。与其焦虑对抗，不如从规律作息、均衡餐盘与温和阻力训练着手，让身体在被善待中，慢慢找回轻盈与节奏。

Reunions not only bring welcome sounds and cheerful laughs, they also create huge appetites. Still, after the Chinese New Year, the numbers displayed on our weighing scales are bound to alarm not a few of us. An expert points out that after the holidays, "giving out luck," which means gaining weight, isn't necessarily only due to eating too much, it's also tied to water retention, fat deposits and imbalance in metabolism. Extreme dieting or explosive "atonement" workouts disturb hormones and the stomach, causing problems in the body. Rather than fighting it with worry, it would be better to perform a regular combination of work and rest, while eating balanced meals, as well as doing both gentle and resistance training exercises, so that by caring for our bodies in this way, we'd slowly be able to find lightness and rhythm in our life.
