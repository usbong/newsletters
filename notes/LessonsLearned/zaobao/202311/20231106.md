> WhatsApp骗局猖獗，男子接到朋友借钱短信，被要求两次汇款后，对方仍要借钱，他过后拨电给朋友求证，才惊觉上当。

Scams on WhatsApp have gotten rampant. Here is a case where a male had received a short message from a friend to borrow money. After being requested to transfer money two times to still borrow money, and after the male did so as requested, he then contacted the friend on the telephone to know the truth, only to realize that he had been duped.

> 从事销售专员工作的路易斯（38岁）在上星期三（10月25日）收到好友兼同事“阿米尔”发来的WhatsApp信息，问他是否能借出3500元。路易斯当下并不多想，通过PayNow转账给对方。

This is an incident from Louis (38), a Sales Specialist, who the previous Wednesday (10/25) received a WhatsApp message from his good friend and colleague, "Amir", asking Louis if he could let him borrow 3,500SGD. Louis did as told without much thought, transferring to his friend the money using PayNow.

> 之后，“阿米尔”再次发短信，称自己原先的银行账户无法登入，因此要求他转账到其他账户。

Afterwards, "Amir" again sent him a short message, saying that he couldn't log into his former bank account, so he was asking Louis to transfer the money to another account.  

> 当时路易斯正在工作忙着招呼顾客，一时不疑有他，便再次转账3500元到“阿米尔”指定的账户。

At the time, Louis was busy calling clients at work, and because he did not for a moment doubt his friend, sent another 3,500SGD to the account that Amir specified. 

> 而就在“阿米尔”再次要求路易斯第三次转账时，他突然意识到可能坠入骗局。

And then, when "Amir" again asked Louis the third time to transfer money, he suddenly became aware that he had fallen into a scam.

> 路易斯告诉《海峡时报星期刊》：“我第二次转账3500元后，骗子竟然还说不够，这时我感到不妥。”

Louise told "The Strait Times Weekly News": "After transferring 3,500SGD to the account the second time, the scammer still said that it was not enough. By this time, I felt that it was preposterous."
