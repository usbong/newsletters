> 在中国和菲律宾因仁爱礁（菲律宾称阿云津礁）主权纷争升级之际，菲律宾和越南于本周二（1月30日）签署谅解备忘录，同意加强海岸警卫队之间的合作，以防在南中国海发生不测事件。

Due to the elevation of tensions between China and the Philippines on the ownership of the Ren'ai Reef (known as the "Ayungin" in the Philippines), the Philippines and Vietnam have signed a Memorandum of Agreement this Tuesday (January 30). The agreement strengthens cooperation between the coast guards of the two nations, so as to defend against unexpected incidents occurring at the South China Sea.

> 菲律宾总统小马可斯本周到越南访问时，两国签署了两份谅解备忘录。另一份是同意设立沟通热线，并成立联合海岸警卫队委员会来讨论共同问题。两国都没有公布协议细节。

When the Philippine President MARCOS Jr this week went to visit Vietnam, the two countries both signed two Memorandums of Agreement. One is to agree to establish a communications hotline, and another is to create a joint-security team that can come to discuss common problems at the coast. The two nations have not publicized the details of the agreement.
