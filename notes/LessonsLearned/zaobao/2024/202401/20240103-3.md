Should you receive prior written authorisation of SPH Media, you agree that (in addition to any conditions that may be attached by SPH Media in approving the use of a bot):

>    you will ensure and procure that no false statement of fact is communicated in Singapore through the Account;
    you will ensure and procure that the Account is not involved in any coordinated inauthentic behaviour;
