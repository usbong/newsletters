> Hallo, I was viewing a YOUTUBE video, when I observed that the movement of the computer mouse became slower, until it appeared that there was no movement anymore at all due to LOADING. I had previously been also viewing another set of YOUTUBE videos and several web pages. Rebooting the Operating System did NOT cause the sound to return, even by using the VLC media player, albeit previously the reboot action solved the problem. Thank you.
