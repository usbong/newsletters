## Lessons learned from using `jinput` to create a Java application to be uploaded on Steam

## 1. What is `jinput`?

`jinput` is an API that lets Java apps receive inputs from an arbitrary controller.

> The API itself is pure Java and presents a platform-neutral completely portable model of controller discovery and polling. It can handle arbitrary controllers and returns both human and machine understandable descriptions of the inputs available.

## 2. Findings

The version of the `Java Virtual Machine (JVM)` has to be newer than the `JDK 1.7` currently usable with Steam via `steamworks4j` (https://github.com/code-disaster/steamworks4j; last accessed: 20240725), the wrapper that allows Java apps to access the `Steamworks C++ API`.

Moreover, the `JVM` should be for a `64-bit system`, so that the `.dll` files used by `jinput` to communicate with the controller connected to a `Windows` machine could function. 

Nevertheless, a `JDK 1.8` for `64-bit systems` is available from the following link:

## More

Without having to recompile the `jinput` (and `jutils`) Java source code, the `.jar` (zip folders containing their pre-compiled class files) can be compiled together with the application being developing and run using a more recent `Java Runtime (JRE)` with version `61.0`.

## 3. Conclusion

To successfully upload the Java app on Steam, the JDK version has to be at `1.7` to work with the `steamworks4j` wrapper. 

If the app need not necessarily be on Steam à la StarCraft® Remastered on Battle.net, then it still appears possible to make use of `jinput`, along with a more recent JDK version such as `61.0`, to create the app. 

Alternatively, the `Simple Direct Library 2 (SDL2)` may offer a solution to creating apps that have controller support and can be uploaded on Steam.

Finally, it's important to remember that based on sales, Steam as a platform has a tendency to favor applications that use high-end 3D graphics and run on Windows.
