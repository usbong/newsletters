> Bill Gates is a businessman, investor, and philanthropist. Bill returns to the Armchair Expert (from India!) to discuss the process of partnering with governments to provide vaccines, what data he looks at to assess what a successful project is, and why he is comfortable being critical of others' ideas. Bill and Dax talk about how impactful having a good meeting with peers can be, how important it is to admit that you aren’t an expert at something, and what superpowers they would want. Bill explains why he loves the history of science, how much of his foundation’s research goes towards world health, and what impacts A.I. will potentially have on the global economy.
