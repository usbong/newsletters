## Steam Powered: Distribution Agreement

> 1.7       "Community Market" is an online market within Steam where Steam Account Owners can sell virtual items to other Steam Account Owners in return for Steam wallet credit. 

> 1.16     "Steam" shall mean Valve's online delivery system.  For the purposes of this Agreement, "Steam" does not include any content, including but not limited to video games, from Company, Valve, or other third parties.


> 2.7       User Reviews.  Company shall not artificially manipulate the user review system for Applications.  For example, Company may not solicit reviews in exchange for anything of value, with a single exception that Company may provide a free copy of the Application to bona fide press or reviewers (who may be required to disclose the gift). 


> 2.6       Application Items and/or Currency.  To the extent any Application supports the sale of digital items or digital currency for use in the Application, Company shall not allow or facilitate the redemption or exchange of such digital items or digital currency for real-world currency.


> 2.8.        Open Source Software.  Company shall not distribute via Steam, or combine any Valve materials with, open source or other software that is licensed under terms that purport to bind Valve to contractual obligations (e.g. the GNU General Public License or Lesser General Public License), without prior discussion with and separate written agreement from Valve.

> In the case of Demo Versions available outside of Steam, if any, if such a Demo Version includes a reference to how/where to purchase the Application (e.g., screens on start or exit), Company shall cooperate with Valve to include a reference to Steam in that location. 

> 4.5       Press Accounts.  As soon as an Application is released on Steam, Valve may add the Application to its press subscription accounts, such that these industry and general interest journalists may access the Application free-of-charge in order to evaluate, and potentially review, the Application. 

> 4.6       Compatibility and Performance Test Accounts.  As soon as Company submits an Application for release on Steam, Valve may add, at no cost and without any payment due to any third party, the Application to select third-party accounts for their use in providing hardware and software compatibility and performance testing in connection with Steam, but only so long as Valve provides its own games to such accounts.


> 6.         REVENUE SHARE.

 
> 6.1       Payment.  Beginning on the date Valve first receives gross revenue from the sale of any Applications over Steam, within thirty (30) days after the end of each calendar month, Valve shall provide a report of gross revenue, adjustments made in calculating Adjusted Gross Revenue, and a report of the payment amount owed, for such month, and pay to Company seventy percent (70%) of the Adjusted Gross Revenue actually received by Valve from Valve's exploitation of each of the Applications pursuant to Section 3.2 during the such calendar month, except that revenue related to Workshop Contributions and game fees from Community Market sales will be paid in accordance with Sections 6.3 and 6.4 below.  Monthly statements will also report revenues and adjustments by Primary Platform, where applicable.  For purposes of such reporting, the "Primary Platform" is the operating system on which the majority of usage occurred during the seven day period following the date of purchase (if no usage occurred during that period, the Primary Platform shall be the operating system on which the Steam Account Owner purchased the Application).  Payments under this Section will only be paid with respect to the version of the Application running on the Primary Platform.  To the extent that the payment calculation results in a negative amount, that negative amount will be carried forward and deducted from any future amounts otherwise payable by Valve hereunder.

> 6.3.2    Sharing of Revenues from Workshop Contribution Sales.  Unless otherwise agreed between the parties, and notwithstanding Section 6.1, Valve will pay Company a share of Adjusted Gross Revenues derived from any sales of Workshop Contributions that occur on a Workshop page specific to a Company Application or within a Company Application.  Unless a different revenue-sharing arrangement is agreed to by the parties, Company's revenue share shall be equal to seventy percent (70%) of Adjusted Gross Revenues, less a percentage to be paid to the contributor(s) that submitted the Workshop Contribution ("Contributor").  Valve may provide Company with the means to set or change the percentage paid to Contributors, and/or the allocation of the contributor percentage amongst contributors in cases of bundled item sales.  If no percentage is specified by Company, the default percentage shall be twenty-five percent (25%) of Adjusted Gross Revenues.

> 6.4.1    Transaction and Game Fees.  Valve charges a "transaction fee" for each sale made in a community market, which is typically equal to five percent (5%) of the amount paid for the item sold (although Valve may adjust this transaction fee in its sole discretion).  The "transaction fee," and the sales proceeds received by the seller in connection with the sale of a virtual item, are excluded from Adjusted Gross Revenues.  In addition to the "transaction fee," a "game fee" may be assessed for each sale made in a community market.  Valve may provide Company with the ability to set or change the "game fee" percentage.  If Company does not specify a different "game fee" percentage, the default percentage shall be ten percent (10%).


> 6.5       Minimum Monthly Payment.  In the event amounts due to Company for a given month do not exceed one hundred dollars (US$100), Valve may elect not to remit payment for that month, and to accumulate payments due until they exceed one hundred dollars (US$100) at the time of a future monthly payment cycle. 

> 6.4.2    Sharing of Game Fee Revenues. Valve will share the "game fee" net of Applicable Adjustments (the "Net Game Fee") with Company.  Unless a different revenue-sharing arrangement is agreed to by the parties, Company's share of the Net Game Fee will be equal to seventy percent (70%), except that, if the item sold is a Workshop Contribution, the Net Game Fee will be equal to seventy percent less a percentage to be paid to the original Contributor(s) of the Workshop Contribution...

> 6.6       Additional Revenue Share.  If an Application generates total Adjusted Gross Revenue in excess of ten million dollars ($10,000,000.00) after October 1, 2018, Valve will pay Company an additional five percent (5%) of the Adjusted Gross Revenue in excess of ten million dollars (US$10,000,000.00) actually received by Valve from Valve's exploitation of that Application pursuant to Section 3.2.  If an Application generates total Adjusted Gross Revenue in excess of fifty million dollars (US$50,000,000.00) after October 1, 2018, Valve will pay Company an additional five percent (5%) of the Adjusted Gross Revenue in excess of fifty million dollars (US$50,000,000.00) actually received by Valve from Valve's exploitation of that Application pursuant to Section 3.2.  If the total Adjusted Gross Revenue for an Application drops below the thresholds listed above due to refunds, chargebacks, or otherwise, Valve may deduct the amounts previously paid under this Section from any future amounts otherwise payable by Valve under this Agreement. 

--> 3.2       Electronic Delivery License.


> Revenue generated through a current or future version of Steam operated for the People's Republic of China in cooperation with a domestic Chinese company will not count towards Adjusted Gross Revenue for the purposes of this section.  Company agrees to use good faith in pricing and bundles to allocate revenue to Applications proportionate to their end-user value. 

> If Valve determines in good faith that Company has manipulated Adjusted Gross Revenue from one or more other Applications to qualify another Application for additional revenue under this Section 6.6, Valve may properly allocate the Adjusted Gross Revenue to the appropriate Applications, in its sole discretion, and reserves the right to cease selling Company's Applications and/or terminate the Agreement. 


> 7.2       Termination by Either Party for Cause.  Either Party may terminate this Agreement immediately upon written notice at any time if the other Party is in material breach of any warranty, term or condition of this Agreement and has failed to cure that breach within thirty (30) days after written notice thereof, or the other Party experiences an Event of Default.  "Event of Default" means any of the following events:  (a) a Party becomes insolvent or is unable to pay its debts as they mature, or makes an assignment for the benefit of creditors; (b) a petition under any foreign, state or United States federal bankruptcy act, receivership statute, or the like, as they now exist, or as they may be amended, is filed by a Party; or (c) such a petition is filed by any third party, or an involuntary petition is not resolved favorably to such Party within sixty (60) days after the petition is filed.


> 9.       INDEMNITY.

> Company will indemnify, defend, and hold harmless Valve and its Affiliates, successors, officers, directors and employees from any cost, loss, liability, expense or damage (including reasonable attorneys' fees) ("Liabilities") arising out of any action, cause of action, claim or demand (a "Claim") based on facts which, if true, would represent a material breach by Company of its representations and warranties under Section 8 of this Agreement.  Company will reimburse Valve upon invoicing for any payment made by Valve in respect of any liability or claim to which any indemnity obligation under this contract relates.  Valve will promptly notify Company of the existence of a Claim (though any delay in providing such notice shall not relieve Company of its obligations unless and only to the extent that such delay prejudiced Company).  Valve shall give Company sole control of the defense of the Claim, provided that Company shall not settle any Claim requiring financial payment from Valve, or the admission of fault, or any non-monetary penalty, unless Valve consents.  Valve will provide is reasonable cooperation to Company, at Company's expense.  Valve may participate in the defense with its own counsel, provided that it shall do so at its own expense, and that ultimate control of the defense shall remain with Company.  


> Company understands that network support may be unavailable due to routine maintenance and unplanned interruptions due to hardware, software and/or Internet failures.  

> Valve may make changes to, add services to, or remove services from Steamworks in its sole discretion, provided that Valve shall use commercially reasonable efforts to ensure that any such changes are backwardly compatible with any Applications that were made commercially available to end users and that incorporated earlier versions of Steamworks features prior to such change.
