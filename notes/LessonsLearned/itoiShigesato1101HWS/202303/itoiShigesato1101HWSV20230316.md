--> adds: speakers to be heard by TARGET;<br/>
--> keyphrase: BUDOL-BUDOL targetting people, e.g. Senior Citizens;<br/>
--> where: hears "VOICE" and experiences HEAD PAIN/DIZZY/THROAT PAIN<br/> 
--> to show group's POWER/"TRUE MESSAGE",<br/>
--> to cause: TERROR/FEAR in TARGET<br/>
--> objective: for TARGET to OBEY the "VOICE",<br/>  
--> OUTPUT: execute INTENDED ACTIONS,<br/>
--> EXAMPLE: give CASH to STRANGER, forget about CASH, leave CASH on table,<br/>
--> where: WAITING STRANGER shall pick-up;<br/>
--> adds: as observation, when attacked TARGET has identified the group's technique,<br/>
--> shall attempt to COMMUNICATE via CCTV, and own VOICE,<br/>
--> where: from nearby people ACTION shall appear STRANGE<br/>
--> TRUMAN SHOW (Movie; CARREY, Jim), as with CM/AD for viewers of TV SHOW;<br/>
