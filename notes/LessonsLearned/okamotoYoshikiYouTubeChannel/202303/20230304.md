ALCATRAZの帽子

### Translated from nihongo to English

Mr AOKI shares his experience with Mr OKAMOTO riding the helicopter. He observed that Mr OKAMOTO got really scared, and was so afraid that he didn't even look outside. In the end, they both can laugh about it, while thinking of how it was such a big waste.

At the time, Mr OKAMOTO was 23 or 24. Mr AOKI was 35 or 36.

Mr OKAMOTO says that it was not a vacation, but a dispatch for work. He explains that Company President, Mr TSUJIMOTO, had told them to look at AMERICA. 

Mr OKAMOTO shows a photograph of a meeting with the executives. Mr AOKI names the people in the meeting.

Starting from the right, there is Mr REDDO ARIIMAA (KOTO, Arima), Mr FUJIWARA, Tokuro, and then Mr AOKI... Mr OKAMOTO is also there, albeit may not be recognizable.

This was 30 years ago.

Mr OKAMOTO then shows a look-alike drawing to Mr AOKI. Mr AOKI recognizes the drawing to be himself. Mr OKAMOTO admits that it was he who drew it. He adds that during work hours, this was what he did.

Mr AOKI says that he must have drawn it in 2~3 minutes. And it was during an employee's meeting, at 11:30, just before LUNCH TIME.

Mr OKAMOTO had observed that Mr AOKI appeared to be pondering whether to combine SET MEAL A with SOBA (flour) NOODLES or UDON (buckwheat) NOODLES.

Mr AOKI exclaims that Mr OKAMOTO must have also passed around the drawing within the company.

Mr OKAMOTO explains that he was a designer who was attending a meeting with developers. So he was out-of-place.

Mr AOKI reminds Mr OKAMOTO to listen carefully during meetings on SALES and PROFITS, albeit admits that to be frank, even if they pondered about such things, they didn't really understood.

Mr OKAMOTO confirms that it was due to being overly TOP-DOWN in their management approach.

But while Mr OKAMOTO's specialty appeared to be outside the use of the Development Unit, we can see the result of what happened based on history.

Mr OKAMOTO had worn a cap with the word, "ALCATRAZ," during their tour in America.
