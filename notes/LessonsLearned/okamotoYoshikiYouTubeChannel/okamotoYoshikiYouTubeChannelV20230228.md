【エグゼドエグゼス】どうしてこうなった…難易度ハードすぎる”EXED EXES”のゲーム仕様はこうして完成した｜元カプコン青木隆さんと対談（＃２）

TO-DO: -update: this

一日に一つ
毎日１キャラ敵が出てくると

「午前中に全部プログラム打って
午後はチェックで出来上がり」

毎日繰り返す

２タイトルだけ、ワンコインクリアできないと

全部クリアするとは、無理だって
むちゃくちゃなんだから

１）「ガンスモーク」
２）「１９４３」

さらに難易度を上げようと
が、あの時、キリのいいゲームを目指す


「魔界村」２周、いやだったと

サイドアームズ

あきまんのデザイナーセンス
「大きいのを動かすっていうふうに考える」

ガンダムの影響
「RーTYPE」、「グラディウス」
横シューティング、ロボット、SF

船水さん、初めなかなか進めなく
最後のまとめ、抜群

キハチさんが入ってから

１）立ち上げのところ得意な人
２）中まとめるのが得意な人
３）後半の調整するのが上手な人

苦手のとこを後輩にやらせて

真ん中

### Translated from nihongo to English

It was one each day. Everyday they came out with an enemy character. 

During the mornings, their team typed programs the whole time, verified them in the afternoons, until the whole thing was done. 

They repeatedly did this everyday.

Mr OKAMOTO shares that there are only 2 game titles that he cannot CLEAR with ONE COIN.

Mr AOKI is surprised that Mr OKAMOTO shall even CLEAR the whole thing with only ONE COIN. He thinks that it's IMPOSSIBLE! He explains that the games become OVERWHELMINGLY CHAOTIC at some point.

These are those two (2) games that Mr OKAMOTO mentioned.

1) GUNSMOKE

2) 1943

Mr OKAMOTO says that they actually could have increased 1943's difficulty level even further, but at the time, he was aiming for a GAME with a GOOD END.

With respect to the Ghosts N' Goblins fans out there, he admits that he didn't quite like its two (2) game world cycles. He thought that he didn't want to do another cycle after he cleared the first one.

SIDE-ARMS is a game which Mr OKAMOTO considers AKIMAN's debut title. From it, we can see AKIMAN's designer sense, which is "as though moving something large."

He adds that they were influenced by GUNDAM, "R-TYPE", "GRADIUS", side-scrolling shooting games, ROBOTS, and Science Fiction (SF).

Mr AOKI tells of Mr FUNAMIZU, who at the start could hardly move forward, but after Mr KIHACHI entered the company, he was quite outstanding in putting everything together at the end.

Mr OKAMOTO shares these three (3) types of people.

1) A person who is good at building up something

2) A person who is good at putting things together

3) A person who is good at adjusting things during the latter half

He adds that it is more effective to let junior employees do the parts with which he, himself, has difficulty.

This way the company can achieve a GAME that has a good balance at the center.
