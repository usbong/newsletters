### MAGAZINE version? The Economist? DW NEWS?; Translated from nihongo to English
 
#### What is the REASON why it is difficult for someone who likes GAMES to enter a GAME COMPANY?

Ms TAPP has plenty of GAME MEMORIES. 

She says that she wants to make GAMES, prepared for it, and applied for a sub-culture JOB, as an OTAKU.

If you show only your GOOD side, the company does so too.

But 5,000 HOURS of PLAYING, it's not a CREATOR's WORK!

She says that she was made to do work that was beyond her actual capability.

Ms TAPP applied at SCE (SONY COMPUTER ENTERTAINMENT), LEVELUP in FUKUOKA (KYUSHU), among others.

She was born in KYUSHU, JAPAN.

During the hiring interview, the parts that stick-out are remembered.

Is there a SENSE of BALANCE? Do you have a "WEAPON, so that NOBODY can defeat you"?

These are said to be deeply considered.
