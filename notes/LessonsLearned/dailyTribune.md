--> where: Constitution : Magna Carta for Women, Labor Code<br/>
<br/>

--> where: RISK : marriage between co-workers<br/>

<br/>
adds: if request that either of the married co-workers be transferred to a different branch still cannot minimize or solve the RISK, the policy cannot justify the dismissal

##### ACTION
