## Keyphrase

#### CASE: BATTLE due to Company A's Policy/Agreement : NOT of Constitution
--> where: Constitution : Magna Carta for Women, Labor Code<br/>
<br/>
1) Constitution<br/>
--> State commits to protect workers and promote full employment and equality of employment opportunities for all<br/>
--> security of tenure

2) Magna Carta for Women<br/>
--> where: "State commits to eliminate discrimination against women and ensures their right to freely choose a spouse."

3) Labor Code<br/>
--> prohibits discrimination, e.g. against women, via requiring condition to continue employment<br/>
--> Example: women employee shall not get married, shall be deemed resigned after marriage, et cetera;

### LEGAL FORUM's Recommended Solution

#### CONDITION

If there is no proof to support Company A's position regarding RISK to its business<br/>
--> where: RISK : marriage between co-workers<br/>
--> policy cannot justify dismissal<br/>
<br/>
adds: if request that either of the married co-workers be transferred to a different branch still cannot minimize or solve the RISK, the policy cannot justify the dismissal

##### ACTION

file: illegal dismissal complaint against Company A
