PANELO, Salvador S

### KEYPHRASE

> "Constitutional change, a must (2)" 

憲法変更が必要（２）

> It is unquestionable that the present members of both houses of Congress, the overwhelming majority of which, for decades, belong to the same generational families, that have been in control and entrenched thereat. 

十数年に伴って現在圧倒的多数の上院且つ下院議員らが、同じ代々の家族に属し、粘りながらも、物事を操っているにちがいない。

> Either they themselves are the vested interest groups or they represent fiercely their principals who constitute the ruling elite, and would naturally resist any change in the status quo that threaten their hold on power, riches and influence.

彼ら自体、或いは国のエリットの代表として、握っているパワー、お金、影響への現状変更の脅威を自然に強く対抗していると、当然である訳だ。
