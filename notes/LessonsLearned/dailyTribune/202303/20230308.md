### KEYPHRASE

> The prime duty of the government is to serve and protect the people.

政府の第一義務は、民族への貢献且つ守備である。

> For as long as laws are wantonly transgressed and culprits go scot-free; for as long as public servants are assassinated by fearless assailants; for as long as citizens walk the streets with fear as their traveling companion; and for as long as the law enforcers are inefficient and lackadaisical in going against the lawbreakers, the citizenry will not feel the service and the protection they are entitled to from the government they have created and the leaders they have given the mandate to lead and govern them.

犯罪者らが、罰なしに、法律を自由に破ったり、公務員を恐怖せずに殺したり、町で歩く民族を脅かしたりしているうち、法執行者のほうも、そいつらを逮捕に追いかけるのが、遅く、怠けで、庶民は、作り上げた政府や投票した代表らからの貢献且つ守備を感じない。
