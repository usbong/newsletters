## COUNTERPOINT

## Author

PANELO, Salvador S

### KEYPHRASE

> The prime duty of the government is to serve and protect the people.

> For as long as laws are wantonly transgressed and culprits go scot-free; for as long as public servants are assassinated by fearless assailants; for as long as citizens walk the streets with fear as their traveling companion; and for as long as the law enforcers are inefficient and lackadaisical in going against the lawbreakers, the citizenry will not feel the service and the protection they are entitled to from the government they have created and the leaders they have given the mandate to lead and govern them.


### USBONG NOTES

1) CAMP CRAME; security unit training

2) scot-free
