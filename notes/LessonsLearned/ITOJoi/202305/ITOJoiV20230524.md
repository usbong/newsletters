### USBONG NOTES

1) news reports, large-scale hacking incidents in JAPAN; mid-2010's; crypo industry

> ...experts mercilessly criticized the nation’s status at the project team (PT) meeting. Japan, which had once led the world's crypto industry up to the mid-2010s, had become a country that was avoided by entrepreneurs both domestically and internationally. As a result of frequent scandals such as large-scale hacking incidents against exchanges, regulations were strengthened, and the crypto industry in the Japanese market lost its attraction due to unclear tax rules and regulations. Many entrepreneurs and investors left Japan to seek better business environments.
