> 最近我疯狂迷恋上了《球比伦战记》。原本我没打算把所有空闲时间都花在这个“roguelite 版《打砖块》”上面，但它强调策略（加一点点运气）的玩法，以及诱人的局内和局外成长系统，彻底俘获了我大脑中掌管原始欲望的“爬虫脑”，让我瞬间忘记了其他的人文活动。我已经玩上头了。事实上，自从几周前开始玩《球比伦战记》之后，我就再没碰过其他游戏。

I've recently been insanely addicted to "Ball x Pit." While I didn't have any plans of using up all my free time playing this "roguelite" Arkanoid, its emphasis on strategy (with the addition of a little bit of luck to the gameplay), as well as an alluring progression system, completely got my brain hooked into wanting to reach higher and higher. It made me instantly forget the rest of my social activities. In fact, I haven't played any other game since after I began playing "Ball x Pit" several weeks ago. 

> 我完全无法挣脱它那极具满足感的游戏循环：挑战一个关卡，升级弹珠，升级局外基地以解锁更多弹珠，然后再重返战场。这就像一种无药可医的病症，但说实话，我不确定我是否真的想要治愈这种疯狂。

I absolutely can't break away from this game's extremely satisfying gameplay loop: take on a challenging stage, upgrade your bullets, unlock more bullets, and then return again to the battles. This seems like an incurable disease, but, actually, I'm not sure if I'd really want a cure for this type of insanity. 

> 我逢人就推荐这个游戏，而所有听了我建议的人最后都会找我来抱怨：“你毁了我的生活，你个混球。”真是太棒了。你也来加入我们吧。让我们一起弹个天昏地暗。

I recommend this game to everyone I meet, and everyone who's heard me will come looking for me to complain: "You've ruined my life, you nut!" It's really that amazing. You can even add us too. Let's play together during one of these dark, late afternoons just before evening comes.
