Tokyo Metropolitan Police Department (MPD)<br/>
--> crimes jump in 2022 via shady job posts<br/>
--> warnings for 3,480 offers of yami baito (shady part-time jobs);<br/> 
--> posted to Twitter in 2022<br/>

--> comes amid a recent spate of robberies across the country linked to such posts

> illegal jobs for high pay.


### OUTPUT

> A number of suspects arrested over a series of recent robberies across the country, including a case in the city of Inagi in Tokyo, have suggested that they responded to the job posts and joined a group carrying out the robberies.

> According to police and suspects, money collectors and other criminals in the cases are being recruited through the job postings, with bank account information also being traded.

### OBSERVATION

> The shady job posts tend to use words and phrases that appear likely to be searched for, such as “debt” and “runaway from home,” as well as “success without fail” and “¥1 million or more a month.”

> “Using sweet words, they are skillfully targeting young people, as well as those with no financial leeway,” a senior MPD official said.

> The police warnings have come in the form of responses such as “Do you dare take on yami baito?” or “Disposable pawns will be arrested and jailed after being used.”


### ACTION

1) requested: by Police for Twitter to delete the posts in question.<br/>
--> adds: however, despite police warnings, similar posts have still reappeared from different accounts;

2) from MPD official: 

> “We are sending a message that we’re watching you. We’ll continue to be persistent in order to prevent crimes.”
