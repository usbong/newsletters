# NOTES: [BPI-AIA Aspire](https://github.com/usbong/newsletters/blob/main/notes/LessonsLearned/BPI/2024/20240215/BPI-AIA-AspireNotedEveryMonth5KPhpApproxEtcLearnFromYourBank20240215.jpg)

reminder: variations in factors, e.g. contribution time span, shall affect the numbers, e.g. monthly contribution input, amount returned every two years; however, from this analysis, I hope that the plan’s value may be clarified;

## —

Plan does not store the 6K approx per month contribution of 20 years in an account that you can easily withdraw from; if you do, it’s considered a loan;

Nevertheless, it returns 50K every two years from the 6th year until your 100th birthday; 

If starting @ earliest; 100-6=94 years,
and if payout done every two years, 
person would have received 2.35 million;

If starting @40 years old,
by 100 years old, they would have returned a total of 1.94 million PHP; barely double the 1.44 million PHP total contribution in 20 years;

6K * 12 * 20 = 1.44 million PHP;
265K paid for service fee (for 20 years), including health insurance, etc;

265K/20/12 = 1104.16 service fee per month (for 20 years);

noted: BPI-AIA Aspire also has “dividends” based on performance of BPI; however, max highest appears to be only approx 100K PHP;
