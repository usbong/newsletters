> For-Profit Companies Charging Sextortion Victims for Assistance and Using Deceptive Tactics to Elicit Payments
The FBI is warning the public of for—profit companies offering sextortion victims “assistance” services. These companies charge exorbitant fees, whereas law enforcement and non-profit agencies will provide assistance at no charge to victims.
The companies use deceptive tactics—including threats, manipulation, and providing false information—to coerce sextortion victims into paying for their services. Some of the services for which the companies charge fees, such as sending the perpetrators cease and desist orders, make victims feel better but are not legally enforceable. The companies may also attempt to discourage victims from reporting the sextortion to law enforcement. Limited reporting indicates the companies are directly or indirectly involved in the sextortion activity.
