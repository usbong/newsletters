# Lessons-learned: Archive of Our Own Beta

## Terms of Service: "tag wrangling"

https://archiveofourown.org/tos_faq#tag_wrangling

> What we do is create organization among all those tags by creating 'Canonical' tags and then adding synonym tags to the Canonical tag. This helps in the media listings, filters, searches, the tag cloud and possibly other areas, as the Canonical tag is used in preference to the synonyms.

> By creating synonyms, when a canonical tag is filtered, it will bring up all fics using both the canonical term and the synonym term. By doing this, we give the authors the freedom to use what tags they choose, but still create order in the Archive so that the tags are actually 'useful'. 

> Tag wrangling is about form, not content. Form includes disambiguation (where a fandom name is the same as a character name, for example: Doctor Who or Harry Potter) and similar issues such as spelling, capitalization, and typographical conventions (for example, we may wrangle tags so that a search for wing!fic also retrieves works tagged wingfic).

> Tag Wrangling is an experimental feature.
