>　時計の針が午前１１時５２分を指した。あの時もこんな秋晴れだったはずだ。

The hands of the clock point toward 11:52AM. During that same time, it should have also been this sunny in Autumn.

> 空に浮かぶ頂を見上げ、そこに巨大な煙が突如わきあがるのを思い描く。長野と岐阜の県境にまたがる御嶽山。

Looking up at the mountain top floating in the sky, I draw in my mind the giant smoke that suddenly flew up there. Mr Ontake is located at the prefecture borders of Nagano and Gifu. 

> 噴火から９年を経て、山頂付近の立ち入りが一部緩和されたと聞き、先日登った

After 9 years have passed since its eruption, I heard that a part of the mountain top vicinity that used to be prohibited for entry has been opened, so I climbed up there the other day.

> ▼空気の清冽（せいれつ）さは、色も引き立てるのだろう。標…
