> 　英語能力試験「TOEIC」の試験会場に侵入したとして、警視庁は中国籍で大学院生の王立坤（おうりつこん）容疑者（27）=京都市左京区=を現行犯逮捕し、19日に発表した。「本名でない身分証を持って試験会場にいたことは間違いない」と容疑を認めているという。署はなりすましやカンニングが目的だったとみて調べている。

The police have announced on the 19th of May the arrest of WANG, Likun (27), a graduate student  having Chinese citizenship from the Sakyo district in Kyoto City, who was caught entering the TOEIC English Proficiency Test examination premises. The suspect was confirmed to have been "in possession of an ID that didn't have his real name at the test venue." He is now being investigated for having as his objective the falsification of his identity as well as cheating, among others. 
 
> 　野方署によると、逮捕容疑は18日午後2時50分ごろ、何者かと共謀し、正当な理由がないのに、東京都板橋区内で行われた試験会場に侵入したというもの。試験の主催者から今月に入り、「最近顔写真は同じだが、名前が違う受験生がいる」などと相談があったという。

According to the Nogata Police Station, the arrested suspect colluded with another person at 2:50PM on the 18th of May, and entered the test venue held in Tokyo Metropolitan's Itabashi District without a valid reason. The organizers of the exam were said to have notified the police at the start of the month regarding an observation that "Recently, there have been examinees whose face is the same as their photo, but whose name is different." 

> 　署員らが18日の試験会場で警戒していたところ、王容疑者が現れ、受け付けで「受験票を忘れた」と申告。過去の受験時と違う名前で予備の受験票を作成しようとしたため、署員らが話を聞いたところ、他人になりすまそうとしたことを認めたという。

While the police were on alert on the 18th of May at the test venue, the suspect, Mr. WANG, came to the reception desk and said, "I forgot my test voucher." Listening to his story, the police confirmed that the suspect tried to pretend to be another person after having attempted to create a test voucher beforehand using a different name from a past exam.

Also, Mr. WANG had a small 3 to 4in mic hidden inside his mask. Earlier, the organizers had also provided information to the police saying that "There had been an unnatural increase in the number of Chinese people whose scores were above 900," "There's an examinee who's speaking bits and pieces of Chinese at the test venue," whose likely purpose according to the police was to tell the answers to another examinee.
