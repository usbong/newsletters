> 　人間とアニメ調のアバター（分身）の顔が交互に画面に映り、金額と確率が表示される。ギャンブルをしますか、しませんか――。アバター相手の方が人はリスクをとりやすいという研究結果を情報通信研究機構（NICT）が発表した。相手が人間かアバターかによって脳の働きに違いが生じ、意思決定を左右していることもわかった。

A human face and an avatar styled as an anime character were both displayed on a screen, along with amounts for money and numbers denoting the probability of success. Will you make a wager? Or not? The National Institute of Information and Communications Technology (NCIT) has presented the results of a research study that found that people easily make high-risk choices when faced with an avatar. It showed that there's a difference in the way the brain behaves based on whether people are faced with a human or an avatar, and that their decision making ability wavers accordingly.

These past few years, there has been an increase in the use of avatars as a way to communicate during online meetings as well as when interacting with guests. However, it had not been previously known how people's decision making process and emotion change when faced with an avatar, as compared to when faced with a human being. Thus, the team at NICT verified this in an experiment with 79 participants comprised of both males and females.

> 　実験では参加者に、報酬は多いが獲得が不確実な高リスクの選択肢と、報酬は少ないが獲得が確実な低リスクの選択肢を画面上に示し、どちらかを選んでもらった。画面には人間かアバターの顔も映しており、リスクの高い選択肢で報酬を獲得すれば称賛する表情、報酬を獲得できなければ軽蔑する表情に変わる。低リスクを選択した場合はそのまま次の試行に進む。これを繰り返し、約10回ごとに人間の顔とアバターの顔を切り替えた。

In the experiment, the participants were shown on the screen two choices: one where they could win a large sum but the risk of failure is high, and another where the reward is small but the risk is low. They were then asked which they'd choose. They were also shown on the screen the face of either a human being or an avatar, and that the expression turned approving if they won the reward and the choice that they made was a high-risk one, while the expression turned contemptuous if the reward was not obtained. If they took the low-risk choice, the test proceeded to the next question. This was repeated for about 10 times while switching between a human face and the one for the avatar.

> 　その結果、人間よりもアバターに見られている時のほうが、参加者はリスクの高い選択をする傾向が出た。統計的に解析すると、画面の相手がどんな表情を返すかわからないあいまいさが参加者の行動の違いを生み出していた。

The results of the study showed that the participants had a tendency to make high-risk choices when faced with an avatar, more so than when faced with a human being. When this is analyzed statistically, the ambiguity in the type of expression that their partner showed on the screen produced a difference in the behaviour of the participants.

Moreover, when this is further studied using Functional Magnetic Resonance Imaging (fMRI), which captures changes in the blood flow in the brain, the activities of the amydala, the part of the brain that controls emotions, differed according to whether the participant is faced with a human or an avatar. It was found that the participants took the ambiguity of the avatar in a friendly way.

In the research study, the team also studied the psychological factors in place, and they found that it was easy to make high-risk decisions for people who worry over what their partner thought and if the partner was an avatar.

For instance, in an online meeting, it's easy to say things when the other side is shown as an avatar. This explains the same mechanism that causes people to buy more than is necessary when the store owner is depicted as an avatar. Mr. HARUNO, Masahiko, the head of NCIT's Brain Information Engineering Laboratory, says, "People behave differently when they're interacting with an avatar. This research highlights that aspect."

The results of the study have been published in the U.S. Science Magazine, Plos Biology ([https://journals.plos.org/plosbiology/article?id=10.1371/journal.pbio.3003122](https://journals.plos.org/plosbiology/article?id=10.1371/journal.pbio.3003122)).
