English Science magazine Nature has announced on the 17th of April that the research teams at Keio University and Osaka University have each separately succeeded in producing an "Organoid of the Liver," a 3D structure that can perform the major tasks of the liver. This organoid, also called, "The Mini Organ," has the potential to be used in regenerative medicine, in the development of drugs as well as in the explanation of mechanisms behind diseases.

It has various roles including the storage and disposal of waste products and the conversion of nutrients into the necessary substances that the liver would need. 

>　ヒトの肝細胞を機能を保ったまま大量に安定的に培養することはむずかしかったが、慶応大の佐藤俊朗教授らのグループは、特定のたんぱく質を使うことによって細胞を100万倍に増やすのに成功した。さらにホルモンを使って培養し、肝臓がもつ毛細胆管の構造を再現したようなオルガノイドができた。

Although it's a challenge to cultivate human liver cells in a stable way and in large quantities while keeping their cellular mechanisms intact, the team led by Prof. SATO, Toshiro of Keio University has successfully increased the number of these cells that can be cultivated by a million fold through the use of a special protein. Moreover, by using the hormone and cultivating it further, he and his team were able to produce an organoid that recreates the structure of the Bile canaliculi, a substance present in the liver.

This organoid has been confirmed to produce glucose, bile, acid and cholesterol, things that the liver produces. In addition, they were able to investigate the medicinal effects of liver fat upon seeing the amount that the organoid was able to accumulate.

## More

Keio University's research team has also shown the possibility of using this genetically altered organoid in organ transplants, in the replication of conditions for a disease to manifest, among others.

Meanwhile, the research team from Osaka University produced an organoid from the liver cells that came from iPS cells. They used a method that mimics the process of creating organs from a fertilized egg. They focused on the differences in the behavior of liver cells according to their location. Using Vitamin C and the molecule Bilirubin, they were able to create two types of liver cells with varying roles. When these two types of cells are cultivated together, they were able to produce a 3D organ that also contained the intermediary cells.

When the team transplanted the several thousands of 0.5 mm organoids to a rat with an unhealthy liver, they were able to confirm that its survival rate increased after one month. Furthermore, to use this in the long-term, it would be necessary to link it with other organs that dispose waste. 

The research team from Osaka University would like to develop the method that uses the organoid as an artificial liver. They aim to provide a temporary support to the liver by linking the blood of a patient whose liver condition has suddenly worsened to an external organoid.

Osaka University Prof. TAKEBE, Takanori says, "We want to link the results of this to the application of bio-artificial livers as well as to research works that seek to find an effective medical treatment plan for every patient."
