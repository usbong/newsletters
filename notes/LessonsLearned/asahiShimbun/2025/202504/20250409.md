The Psychology of Time

> 　時間の感じ方は，代謝だけでなく，脳の情報処理速度によっても影響を受けることがわかっている。情報処理速度が上がると，時間が実際よりも遅く流れているように感じるのだ。脳の情報処理速度は，感情の興奮によって上がると考えられている。

Our sense of time is not only affected by our metabolism. Recent research has revealed that it's also affected by the speed by which the brain processes information. When this processing speed becomes faster, time is felt to move much more slowly than it actually is. Excitement is considered to be the emotion that increases its speed.

> 　1984年に，イギリスの心理学者フレイザー・ワッツらは，クモ恐怖症の人とそうでない人を対象に，無色透明のガラスケースに入ったクモを見たときの時間の感じ方のちがいを調べた（Watts ＆ Sharrock, Percept. Mot. Skills. 1984;59(2):597-598）。

In 1984, English Psychologist Fraser Watts et al. investigated the difference in people's perception of time when those who have arachnophobia and those who didn't looked at a spider inside a colorless and transparent glass case (Watts & Sharrock, Percept. Mot. Skills. 1984;59(2):597-598).

> 　その結果，物理的時間でクモを見たのは45秒だったのに対して，クモ恐怖症の人は平均で約56秒だと感じ，そうでない人は平均で約33秒だと感じたという。このように，恐怖を感じているときは，時間を実際よりも長く感じやすいようだ。

The result of the experiment showed that the participants looked at the spider for 45 seconds in physical time, but those with arachnophobia felt that it was on average about 56 seconds, while those without arachnophobia felt that it took an average of about 33 seconds. Hence, it appeared that whenever a person becomes frightened, it's also easier to have the sense that time is much longer than it actually is.

> 　もしかしたら，ジェットコースターが苦手な人は，好きな人よりも，ジェットコースターに乗っている時間を長く感じているのかもしれない。恐怖を感じるときほど早く時間がすぎてほしいと願うものだが，むしろ遅く感じてしまうのが人間の心理のようだ。

Perhaps the people who aren't fond of roller coasters feel that the time they spend riding the roller coaster is much longer than those who enjoy it. While they may want time to pass more quickly as with the case of fear, what they feel instead is that time is moving more slowly, an indication that it's something related to human psychology.

> 　さらに，命をおびやかすほどの危険や恐怖がせまっているときには，まわりの風景がスローモーションのように極端に遅く動いているようにみえることがある。しばしば，交通事故にあった人が体験する現象だ。これは「タキサイキア現象」とよばれている。

Furthermore, it's been observed that the surrounding sceneries move extremely slowly as in slow-motion when the person is faced with a life-threatening danger or is scared. This is a phenomenon that is frequently experienced by people who've been in a traffic accident. It's also been called, "Slow-motion Effect."

> 　かつては，タキサイキア現象というものは存在せず，スローモーションで見えるのは錯覚にすぎないと考えられていた。そう思わせる実験が2007年に報告されたからだ（Stetson et al, PLOS ONE. 2007;2(12):e1295）。

In the past, this slow-motion effect didn't exist, and it was thought that seeing something in slow-motion is nothing more than an illusion. Indeed, this is what an experiment reported in 2007 would have us think (Stetson et al, PLOS ONE. 2007;2(12):e1295).

In the experiment, freefall was conducted in an amusement park where none of the participants wore a safety rope and had to do a freefall from a height of about 31m until they reached the safety net below. The participants had a display attached to their arm to show text that they had to check while falling. On the display, text and background drawings were shown in a combination of red and black pixel dots that changed at high-speeds. When the speed of the change in the pixels was increased, the participants couldn't anymore recognize the difference between the text and the pixel-dot drawings. If the speed in the processing of the brain increased due to the fear of falling, the participants should have been able to read the text even when the speed by which the pixels changed became  faster.

However, even when the participants felt that the time it took them to complete their freefall was longer than it actually was, it was found that there was no difference in the maximum speed by which the pixels changed so that the participants could still check the text on the display. Thus, there was no slow-motion effect in actuality, and that it was the capacity of the brain to firmly remember things related to fear that created the illusion. From this experience, Prof. ICHIKAWA, Makoto, who does psychology-related research work at Chiba University, pointed out that looking at the display mounted on the participant's arm is difficult. "We cannot disregard the slow-motion effect just because of this experiment." 

<b>Slow-motion can be observed during happiness</b>

Prof. ICHIKAWA et al. conducted this next type of experiment to examine the slow-motion effect (Kobayashi ＆ Ichikawa, Jpn. Psychol. Res. 2016;58(3):273-283). He had the participants sit on a chair, and instructed them to look at images displayed on the computer screen for one second. Afterward, the color index of the images was dropped. The images were shown to the participants for only 0.01 to 0.06 seconds. Then, the participants had to answer whether or not they saw a change in the color. As with the freefall amusement park experiment mentioned earlier, if the slow-motion effect did exist, the participants would have been able to recognize the change in the color even if the speed by which it changed was made faster.

The result of the experiment showed that it became easier for the participants to notice the change in the color in a shorter span of time. When an image such as a photograph of a snake made them feel a sense of danger, it was found that it was easier for them to sense that time moved more slowly than if the photograph made them feel at ease. From this it was concluded that it became easier to catch instantaneous changes in the color when there is a sense of fear or danger, because the brain's speed of processing visual information increased.

The results of this research validated for the first time the existence of the slow-motion effect. However, afterward, a question was raised on the possibility that the color distribution in the image of the said snake could have affected the outcome. Thus, Prof. ICHIKAWA conducted again the experiment using human faces whose image color index resembled each other (Kobayashi ＆ Ichikawa, i-Perception. 2023;14(1):1-20).

The images had four types of expressions: anger, fear, happiness, and expressionless. Just as with the previous experiment, and given more or less the same conditions, it was confirmed that the participants were able to perceive changes in the color for a shorter span of time when the images expressed anger, fear and happiness, instead of only expressionless.

But what needs to be emphasized is that the brain's speed in processing information increases not only when the expressed emotion is anger and fear. Even happiness can produce the same result. Up until this point, the slow-motion effect had been thought to be related to negative emotions like the sense of danger or fear. However, the results of Prof. ICHIKAWA's experiment revealed that the slow-motion effect can also occur with a positive emotion like happiness.

Prof. ICHIKAWA then said, "In the context of perceiving time, the color index of the image and whether the image looks pleasant or not are not the only factors. Excitement is also important. Still, we don't yet know why excitement is linked to our sense of time. Therefore, our plan from hereon is to investigate further things such as whether or not time can be sensed to move more slowly when the level of excitement is higher, as well as find out if our sense of time changes based on the differences in our emotions."
