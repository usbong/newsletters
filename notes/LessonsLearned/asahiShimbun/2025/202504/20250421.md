A 100-year old woman fell at a home for the aged care-giving facility, and fractured her arm. The incident occurred while she was going to the toilet by herself late in the evening. Does the responsibility fall on the side of the care-giving facility according to the law?

Beginning 2018, the woman had been staying for short periods (short stay) at the care-giving facility. Since the woman needed the use of a walker, the facility decided in 2019 to classify her as a "Nursing Care Level 2," someone that needs partial assistance.

The incident occurred in May 2021. At the late hours of the evening, the woman woke up, put on her slippers by herself, and went out of her room using the walker. While trying to enter the toilet, she fell in front of the door, fractured her arm and had to be hospitalized for about three months.

The woman filed a lawsuit in 2022 seeking compensation from the executives of the social welfare corporation that runs the said facility. "If its management had taken preventive measures, this incident would not have occurred," she complained.

The woman pointed out in the lawsuit that based on factors like her old age, which is at 100 years old, and her need of a walker, "the facility's management foresaw the occurrence of the incident." She complained that the facility had the duty to prevent her falling down by having its caregiver to accompany her whenever she moved about during late at night.

They explained that the woman had never before fallen inside the facility, and had also been able to go to the toilet by herself using the walker during the evenings. The management added that having someone to accompany her with the said task wasn't necessary. They also sought to dismiss the case by saying that they didn't foresee such an incident would occur.

<b>The facility was ordered to compensate the woman: "The incident was foreseen by the management."</b>

The woman won the case based on the decision made by the Shizuoka Trial Court in February 2024. Weighing heavily the responsibility of the facility, the court ordered the management of the facility to compensate the woman. 

Upon foreseeing incidents such as the woman falling at the care-giving facility, "the management has the duty to take concrete actions to prevent such incidents from occurring."
