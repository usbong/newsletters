> 賃金をキャッシュレス決済の口座に振り込む「デジタル給与払い」が解禁される見通しとなった。口座残高は100万円が限度だ。ただ、業者が破綻（はたん）した場合などの賃金の保護が十分なのか不透明な面もあり、識者は「労働者側にはメリットが少ない」と指摘する。

It's now more likely that the ban prohibiting "digital payments of worker salaries" will soon be lifted. The rule says that the maximum amount that can be stored in the balance is 1 million yen (approx. 500,000 PHP). However, the part about whether or not the salaries are kept secure when the service provider goes bankrupt, etc. still remains unclear, indicating that for the worker, "the service has very little advantage."

"The worker's salary covers his daily living expenses, and it's largely believed that this flow of income is both safe and sure. This is why, it's difficult to simply accept the idea that its safety would be compromised just for the sake of convenience."

The Japanese government has explained that the maximum amount that can be insured in the event that a business goes bankrupt is 1 million yen (approx. 500,000 PHP). Since the maximum amount of money that can be saved in a person's account doesn't have a limit, the risk that the worker will be bearing is huge.

During a meeting that began in August 2020, it was proposed that the maximum amount of money that can be saved in the account be set to 1 million yen, which a representative of the labor group also approved, "We've been able to find alignment with the system. We accept this as a measure to ensure the security of capital."

However, in the event that bankruptcy does occur, it's still not clear how the maximum amount of 1 million yen could be ensured. The service provider has explained that it would pay the amount through the deposit money that it paid. Still, "in actuality, each service provider decides on how to pay the insurance money," and the feeling that this aspect is dependent on the provider cannot be removed.

With regard to digital payments, Atty. SHIMAZAKI, Chikara, an expert on workers' rights, says, "the policy addresses the needs of the stakeholders, which include the worker's company as well as the service providers of cashless payments." There are cases when the service fee is much lower using cashless payments than through the bank. He added that this is what the side of the company is after when they decide on whether they should go for digital payments all the way or not. "It's vital that the side of the company grows, so that the aim of the workers would be valued."
