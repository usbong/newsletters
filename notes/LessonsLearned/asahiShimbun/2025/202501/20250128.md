> 　高額療養費制度は、公的医療保険の「セーフティーネット」として機能している。高額な治療を受け、窓口での支払いが高くなっても、上限があることで、自己負担を一定額に抑えることができる。月々の自己負担の上限は、その人の年齢や所得区分によって決まる。

The law to curb the high costs of medical treatment works through "Safety Net," Japan's public health insurance. Even if over-the-counter payments to receive high-cost treatments are increasing, the amount that an individual has to pay can be set to have an upper limit. This monthly upper limit is based on things like the person's age and his income bracket.

> 　政府は、増え続ける社会保障費の伸びを抑えるため、2025年度当初予算案で、高額療養費制度を見直し、自己負担限度額の計算に使う基礎的な部分の金額の引き上げを盛り込んだ。政府案では、25年8月に所得区分ごとに2.7～15%を引き上げ。さらに、26年8月と27年8月にも区分を細分化して引き上げる。最終的には、中間的な収入の人で現行から5万8500円増の月13万8600円となる層がある。

To control the continuously increasing costs of social security, the Japanese government has re-evaluated current laws on high-cost medical treatments in a new budget plan for the year 2025. This includes increasing the basic amount used to compute the costs that an individual pays. According to the plan, the government will be increasing in August 2025 this basic amount by 2.7% up to 15% for each income bracket. In addition, in August 2026 and August 2027, the brackets are going to be further subdivided and the amounts increased accordingly. Finally, for middle-income earners, it's now 138,600 yen (approx 69,300 PHP) per month, an increase by 58,500 yen (approx 29,250 PHP).  

> 　患者への影響は大きい。全がん連が行ったアンケートの中で、がん患者の30代女性は「突然の病で働くことができなくなり、高額療養費制度に助けられているが、治療費は毎月限度額いっぱいの支払いです」と訴える。生活費も含めれば夫だけの収入ではままならないため周りからお金を借りていると明かす。「私の医療費が高くなってしまえば子どもの学費も出してあげられない」とつづる。

This has a huge impact on patients. In a survey that the All Cancer Federation conducted, female cancer patients in their 30's complained, "I suddenly couldn't work because of my illness. The law that curbs the high costs of medical treatment helps me, but I still have a lot of monthly bills to pay to receive the treatment." She revealed that if she included her daily living expenses, her husband's income alone wouldn't be enough. This is why she borrows money from people around her. "If my medical bills further increased, I won't be able to pay for my children's school tuition."

> 　全がん連の天野慎介理事長は、「近年、長く高額な薬を飲み続けることを前提とした治療が増えている。こうした治療は続けなければ長期生存がかなわない。高額療養費が引き上げられれば、患者への影響は甚大で、生活が成り立たなくなったり、治療をやめたりするケースが出てくるおそれがある」と話す。

The chairman of the All Cancer Fedaration, Mr. AMANO, Shinsuke, says, "In recent years, medical treatment has been increasing given that patients continue to take long-term, high-cost medicines. If such medical treatment stopped, people wouldn't be able to live a long life. If the price of high-cost medical treatment is raised, its impact on patients would be huge, and it's likely that they'd quit medical treatment altogether and won't be able to survive."

> 　全がん連は昨年末、負担上限額引き上げの軽減や影響の緩和策を求める要望書を厚生労働相らに提出。アンケートも今後、厚労相に提出予定だという。

The All Cancer Federation has submitted to the Ministry of Health, Labor and Welfare a proposal requesting for an impact alleviation measure to reduce the amount of money that the individual patient has to pay. There are also plans to send the survey they conducted to the Ministry afterward.

"It's a problem that wants everyone to think about himself."

Even if laws that attempt to alleviate the current situation exist, there are people who've begun to think about getting a divorce due to life-related difficulties and to reduce medical, living and school expenses. Moreover, there are people who've borrowed money, delayed paying their taxes, etc. 

Mr. KURODA, Chiharu, the Director of the Patient Financial Support Association, pointed out, "To a certain extent, it's understandable that the amount of money that an individual has to shoulder for high-cost medical treatment has increased along with the increase in the use of high-cost medicine. However, isn't it also necessary to examine the ways by which a person can shoulder his own expenses given his capabilities as well as his household's situation during the medical treatment?"

The law that curbs high-cost medical expenses doesn't only include cancer; patients with all sorts of illnesses take advantage of it. Mr. KURODA said, "Right now, it's a problem that wants even healthy people to think about themselves."
