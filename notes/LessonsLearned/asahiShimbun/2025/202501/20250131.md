> 　いわゆる「生活習慣病」と呼ばれることの多い2型糖尿病、脂質異常症、高血圧のいずれも、家族に患者がいると本人のリスクも大きく高まることが、新潟大や虎の門病院（東京都）のチームの解析で確認された。

A study done by the team at Niigata University and Toranomon Hospital (Tokyo City), among others, has confirmed that for many of the so-called, "Lifestyle-related Diseases," such as Type-2 Diabetes, Dislipidemia and Hypertension (High Blood Pressure), the risk that a person would get sick is greatly increased when there's already a patient in the family with any of those illnesses.

> 　こうした病気には食事や運動習慣もかかわるため、「自己責任だ」などとする声が上がることもあるが、実際には本人にはどうしようもできない遺伝的な要因も小さくないことが改めて示された。

Since such illnesses are related to daily habits like eating and exercise, a number of people have commented, "It's your own responsibility." However, the reality is that the hereditary factor, something a person cannot alter, isn't small.

> 　チームは、虎の門病院健康管理センターの人間ドックを受診した約4万1千人を対象に、親、きょうだい、祖父母にこれらの病気にかかった人がいるかを問診票で尋ねた。家族にいずれかの病気を発症した人がいる場合はいない場合と比べ、本人が同じ病気である確率（有病リスク）がどれだけ異なるかを解析した。

The team conducted a survey asking approx. 41,000 patients of the Toranomon Hospital Health Management Center if they have a family member such as a parent, a sibling or a grandparent who is sick. The team then compared the two cases where one has a family member who is sick and another who doesn't to analyze how big a risk it would be that the person himself would get the same illness.

## > 脂質異常症も2.8倍

## 2.8 times more likely to have Dislipidemia

> 　その結果、これら家族のうち1人でも発症者がいる人の同じ病気の有病リスクは、いない人に比べて2型糖尿病で3.20倍、脂質異常症で2.81倍、高血圧で2.25倍高かった。

The result is that the risk that even one of the family members would get the same illness went up by 3.2 times for Type-2 Diabetes, 2.81 times for Dislipidemia and 2.25 times for Hypertension, when compared with those without a family member who's sick.

> 　どの病気も、家族内で病気を発症した人数が多いほど本人の有病リスクも高まった。

Whichever illness it may be, as the number of sick people within the same family increased, the risk that the person himself would also get sick increased.

> 　特に2型糖尿病では、祖父母、親、きょうだいの3世代のいずれにも患者がいる人の有病リスクは、家族歴がない人の20倍に達した。

In particular, with the case of Type-2 Diabetes, the risk is increased by 20 times when a person has a sick grandparent, parent, sibling or any family member from any of these three generations, as compared to someone who doesn't have a family history of the disease.

## MORE

Whichever among the three illnesses it may be, there's also a greater risk that the person would get life-threatening illnesses like stroke and heart attack in the future. However, the risk of heart attack, etc. can be lowered through early detection and treatment.

Niigata University (Metabolic Endocrinology) Professor and team member, Dr. SONE, Hirohito says, "We especially want people who have family members who are sick to undergo regular check-ups, so as not to overlook the possibility of their getting sick as well."

## The risk varies depending on the degree of obesity

Based on the team's analysis, those with a family history of Hypertension, and whose Body Mass Index (BMI) (body weight (kg) ÷ height (m) ÷ height (m)) is over 30 is 18.99 times more at risk than the person without a family history of Hypertension and has normal BMI (18.5-24.9). However, even a person with a normal BMI but with family history of the disease is 2.22 times more at risk. 

## --

Dr. SONE says, "Even if there's a family history of the disease, the risk can still be greatly lowered through preventive measures such as not smoking, doing appropriate exercise and avoiding obesity."

The team also investigated the risk that a person who, at the start, was not a patient during the study would get sick from Type-2 Diabetes, etc., and they were able to confirm that family history increases the risk of getting sick from such illnesses.

As for the case when family members get the same illness, it's also likely that common activities, such as the family's eating habits, would have impacted this outcome. However, with regard to how big the link between the hereditary factor and the family habits really is, results showed that this cannot be said for all due to large individual differences.

On the so-called "Lifestyle-related Diseases," there are people who've complained that it's easy to promote the bias that "it's because of poor diet."
