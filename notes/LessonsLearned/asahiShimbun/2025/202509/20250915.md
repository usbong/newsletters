> 兵庫県・広瀬正明さん（69）からの質問

A question from HIROSE, Masaaki (69) of Hyogo Prefecture

>　ののちゃん　おばあさんが「体を輪切りにされた」って言っててびっくりしちゃった。よく聞いたら病院の検査だったよ。

Nono-chan: I was surprised when Grandma said that "her body was sliced." Upon paying close attention, I found out that it was about a hospital examination.

>　藤原先生　CTかMRIかな。体の中を輪切りするように映し出して病気を調べる装置だね。

Mr. FUJIWARA (Teacher): I wonder if she's talking about CT scan or MRI? They're machines used to investigate illnesses by producing photographs of the insides of the body that have been sliced.

>　のの　ほんとは切らないのに、どうして体の中が見えるの？

Nono-chan: How can the insides of the body be visible if there was almost no slicing done?

>　先生　ドラマで、横になった患者さんがドーナツ型の装置に入っていくのを見たことないかな。

Teacher: I wonder if you've ever seen in drama programs a patient is put inside a donut-shaped machine while lying on the bed?

>　のの　あるかも！

Nono-chan: I may have seen it!

>　先生　これがCTやMRIの装置。それぞれ、コンピューター断層撮影、核磁気共鳴断層撮影などと言うよ。見た目は似ていて、体を輪切りにした断面を描き出すのも一緒だけど、仕組みは違う。

Teacher: That's a machine for doing a CT scan, MRI or similar. A CT is for Computer Tomography, while MRI is for Magnetic Resonance Imaging. They look similar, and while they both depict regions of the body by slicing them, their mechanisms are different.

>　のの　どう違うの？

Nono-chan: How are they different?

Teacher: CT is the same as X-ray photography in that it uses X-rays that can pass through the body. It releases X-rays in various directions by spinning at high speeds inside the donut-shaped machine. This is caught by a detector on the opposite side. It's also said that in one round, about 1,000 images are taken.

Nono-chan: Bones are depicted as white in X-rays? 

Teacher: Bones don't let X-rays easily pass through them unlike the surrounding areas. Even in CT scans, researchers are studying how much X-rays could pass through. Various orientations from many data sets are processed using the computer to find out which places the X-rays could easily pass through and which are difficult. The distribution in the shades of these X-rays is then turned into an image.

Nono-chan: How about the MRI?

Teacher: It uses the moisture inside the body. Water is made of hydrogen and oxygen. When the machine's magnet is activated, the orientation of the separate hydrogen atoms align. When they're hit by an electromagnetic wave, their orientation changes, and when they return to their previous orientation, weak electromagnetic waves come out. Various things can be measured based on this response. There's even a way to find out the position of where the electromagnetic wave came out. By combining data, a cross-section can be produced. 

Nono-chan: It sounds like a difficult topic. In any case, it looks at the moisture inside the body.

Teacher: That's why MRI is suitable for soft parts of the body where there's plenty of moisture. It can be used to study changes in the body, swellings in the brain, etc. CT is for investigating the lungs where there's plenty of air. It takes detailed photos in a short period of time. It's also suitable for hard parts like the bones or bleeding inside the brain. Both the images of each are also compared.

Nono-chan: They're different in what they're good at.

Teacher: While an advantage of the MRI is that X-rays aren't used, the magnets are so powerful that wearing metallic objects isn't allowed while undergoing an MRI exam. There are also people who'd feel uneasy with an MRI, because they'd need to be inside a small space for a long time and would need to hear all sorts of sounds continuously. 

Nono-chan: Since when have we had the MRI?

Teacher: The CT spread in the 1970's, while the MRI, in the 1980's. The current type of CT that is prevalent is the one that can take a wide photograph all at once, and beautiful images can be obtained from only a few X-rays. It's said that recent advancements in technology for both are pushing forward improvements in the quality of the images using Artificial Intelligence (AI).
