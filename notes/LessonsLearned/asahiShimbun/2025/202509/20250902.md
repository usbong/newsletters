>　始まりは、一通の封筒だった。

It began with one envelope.

>　昨年6月、神奈川県内に住む会社員の40代男性の自宅に封書が届いた。差出人は、男性が契約するインターネットのプロバイダー。「意見照会」という文書が入っていた。

In June of last year, a sealed letter arrived at the home of a male office worker living in Kanagawa Prefecture. The sender was the man's Internet Service Provider. It contained a document called "Opinion Inquiry."

>　読み進めるうち、恐怖を覚えた。

As he continued to read the letter, he felt scared.

>　「アダルト動画の制作会社が、あなたの違法なダウンロードで著作権を侵害されたとして、あなたの名前や住所の開示を求めて裁判所に申し立てた。プロバイダーとして、あなたの情報を開示していいか」――。そんな趣旨が書かれており、男性がダウンロードした動画1本の作品名も記されていた。

"The company who owns the adult video has petitioned the court to disclose your name and address after having infringed on their copyright by illegally downloading their video. As your Internet Service Provider, would you agree to our disclosing information about yourself?" With that type of gist, the company also wrote the name of the specific video that the man downloaded.

Without a doubt, the man had downloaded the video using his PC at home. He had been using the file-sharing software "BitTorrent" since seven or eight years ago.

BitTorrent's users number to tens of thousands, and whose particular feature is that large amounts of data could be easily sent and received. However, downloaded data like movies and games could be questioned for infringing copyright laws.

The man didn't comprehend how copyright worked, and was said to have simply downloaded the file. I thought that "nobody would know about it," and replied to his provider, "not to disclose." He also couldn't talk about it with his wife.
