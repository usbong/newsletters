This 3rd of September, the police have announced the arrest of four people including suspect KITAGAWA, Yuki (28), a resident of Chuo District, Tokyo and the live video streamer who broadcasted lascivious behavior on the overseas adult site, "Stripchat."

Stripchat is the world's largest adult site for individuals who stream live and lascivious videos. The public exposure of the streamer is reported to be Japan's first.

>　保安課によると、他に逮捕されたのは、配信の出演者ら20～40代の女性3人。4人の逮捕容疑は3～8月、ストリップチャットでわいせつな行為を無修正で生配信し、視聴者に閲覧させたというもの。

According to the police's safety and security unit, the other people arrested are the three female performers who're currently in their twenties to forties. The four were pending arrest from March to August due to having live streamed uncensored videos of their lascivious behavior on Stripchat and which got viewers to watch them.

KITAGAWA goes by the name, "Stripchat Expert's Office," and had been recruiting streamers with "Max 80% Compensation Rate" on X (formerly Twitter). For his "studio," he had prepared a room and made use of equipment, taking on the task of streaming videos of the applicants acting lasciviously, and is reported to have shared with them the earnings from their viewers' "thrown coins," among others.

"We're giving our all out support so that everyone can earn through our distribution system," "There are only a few Japanese performers on Stripchat," "The highest monthly income attained in 2024 is 1.6 million yen"

The businessman who was brought out into the open by the police for public lasciviousness used these enticing words to recruit "Stripchat" streamers via X (formerly Twitter), among other social media platforms. There are also numerous other businessmen who post in the same way on X in order to recruit streamers. They offer the idea of shared "earnings" as enticement.

Stripchat is a video uploading site based overseas. It has over 100,000 streamers worldwide. Upon accessing the site, thumbnails (sample images) of the uncensored videos line up.

According to investigators, the website gets viewers to come look at the thumbnails, from which they can view even more sexually stimulating behavior by using purchased coins. The streamers, for their part, can gain rewards based on the coins that they've acquired.

The streamer who's been exposed to the public took a percentage of the money paid by his viewers through Stripchat as "service fee," and shared the rest of the money with the female performers. Investigators say that "Since the videos are streamed online, the women don't get directly and physically harmed. There are even those who regarded it as a type of part-time job."

With respect to the uncensored videos, streamers and people connected to the video uploading site, FC2, are getting brought out into the open. However, as the platform diversifies, there's been no end to the videos suspected of having been illegally posted and streamed.

Aside from this incident, four people who each streamed videos independently on Stripchat have also been exposed by the police in July for acting lasciviously in public. Among these, one is reported to have been streaming videos "in order to settle a housing loan payment" without the knowledge of family members.

According to investigators, there's a growing trend among sex workers who perform in adult videos and stream uncensored content under the premise of enticing phrases like "It's a high-income earning part-time job that is 'difficult to bring out into the open,' 'has no in-person meetings' and 'without touching.' Many women ages 18 years old, up to their fifties, are active here." An investigator points out, "This has penetrated our society like those shady part-time jobs. Meanwhile, their viewers are encouraging criminal behavior."

Police Officials have issued a warning, "Even if the person himself only intends to face the screen and perform, people all over the world on the other side of the screen would see it, and the content could remain as a digital tattoo online."
