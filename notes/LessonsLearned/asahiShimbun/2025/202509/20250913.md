Optimistic people imagine a similar future... This fact was made clear in a research study done by a team from Kobe University and others who used fMRI technology to visualize activities happening inside the brain. The study is believed to be useful in things like mutual understanding and the building of human relationships.

The results have been published in the Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences ([https://doi.org/10.1073/pnas.2511101122](https://doi.org/10.1073/pnas.2511101122)).

>　楽観的な人は、未来の良いことを、悪いことよりも鮮明に思い描くといった特性がある。しかし、それが脳活動としてどう表れるか、詳しくは分かっていなかった。また、社会で人間関係を築きやすいことも報告されているが、思考の特性と、どう関わるのかも明らかではなかった。

An optimistic person is someone who can more vividly imagine that good things would happen in the future instead of the bad. Showing this through activities in the brain had not been well understood. Also, while there are already reports that show that optimistic people are easily able to build human relationships in a given society, it wasn't clear how this is related to the intricacies in people's thought processes. 

>　チームは、機能的磁気共鳴画像法（fMRI）をつかった実験で、その解明に挑んだ。脳のある領域が活動すると血流量が増えるが、fMRIはそれに伴う信号変化を検出し、脳活動を画像化することができるからだ。

The team was able to quickly find the answer to this problem by conducting experiments using fMRI technology. The amount of blood circulating inside the brain markedly increases in the regions that are active. The fMRI identified changes in the brain signals that accompanied this activity, and was able to turn them into images. 

> 具体的には、25～44歳の男女計87人にfMRI装置に入ってもらい、「宝くじが当たる」「スーツをクリーニングに出す」「友人にだまされる」など、60～80のエピソードを、未来に自分またはパートナーに起こることとして想像してもらい、脳活動を記録した。その後、心理アンケートに答えてもらい、参加者の楽観性を評価した。

In the study, a total of 87 male and female participants ages 25 to 44 years old were asked to enter an fMRI machine and were made to imagine their own or their partner's future based on 60 to 80 episodes that included "Hitting the lottery," "Bringing the suit to the laundry," and "Getting deceived by a friend," while the activities in their brains were being recorded. Afterward, they were asked to answer a psychological survey and their optimism levels evaluated.


## More

The study showed that optimistic people have a similar pattern of activity in certain regions of the brain when they imagined the future. On the other hand, people with low levels of optimism had another type of pattern that was scattered and didn't resemble the one for those who were optimistic. Furthermore, the researchers were able to clearly identify the differences in their brain activities when they imagined both the good and the bad things that might come in the future, just like with the people who were optimistic.

In a research analysis done by Assoc. Prof. YANAGISAWA, Kuniaki from Kobe University (Social Neuroscience), it was found that "Pessimistic people aren't able to find the "good" things that many people see happening in the future, while optimistic people, who also couldn't do so, are only a few. Through a common ability to emotionally organize the future, it becomes easy for optimistic people to understand each other's thinking process, as well as to maintain relationships in a given society.

Becoming aware of the problem of social isolation, "It's not just about being the same as your neighbor"

While the theme of the research study is "optimism," the underlying idea behind this is to become aware of the problem of "social isolation and loneliness."

Specializing in social psychology, Mr. YANAGISAWA is also studying how to prevent and visualize the risk of new graduates and first year university students falling into social isolation and loneliness. He began the research study in order to show "the traces that bring people together," given that it's now possible to get a sense of the "optimism" that people who hardly feel isolated have.

This time, it's been found that on average, optimistic people have similar areas in the brain that process information when they imagine the future. On the other hand, pessimistic people fall outside this group, with each one going their own individual way.

However, this doesn't mean that "I'm telling you to imitate optimistic people." The fact that people could do things differently is at times a valuable ability. "We researchers actually have our own peculiarities. But we don't feel isolated thanks to a research community that is mutually understanding."

I want to share with the whole community that "It's not just about thinking like your neighbor." Mr. YANAGISAWA tells people who are isolated and lonely, "At the least, we can bring people together by sharing this way of doing things. And this is something that I've wanted to support, in particular."
