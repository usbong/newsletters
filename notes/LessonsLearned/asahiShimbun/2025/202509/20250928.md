Ms. HIDAKA, Noriko (TENDO, Akane) recalls the anime of the prior generation, "At the time, I wondered if it was all right having only young people included in the cast. While getting people of the same generation together meant that there were times when it was fun while others worrisome, we were all very much politely taken care of at the workplace."

Ms. HAYASHIBARA, Megumi (Ranma) spoke about her approach to the series, "All members of the staff are fundamentally serious. I bring my own philosophy when I think about how I'm going to immerse myself in the anime. I believe that this comes out in my work."

Ms. SAKUMA, Rei (Shampoo) says, "Everyone gives his or herself generously and straightforwardly. We encourage one another, instead of fighting and competing among ourselves." Even now, the set is a welcoming place for everyone to further improve.

Mr. YAMAGUCHI, Kappei (SAOTOME, Ranma), who played the lead role for the first time in the prior anime, remembers, "Everyone was my role model. I didn't do a single ad-lib during the fights, something that I learned after seeing Ms. HAYASHIBARA do it." It was a time when he was trying to catch up with the other members.

Before performing Mr. SEKI, Toshihiko (Mousse), who'll be joining the series starting from the second season, says that he compared the prior and the current anime series. "I realized that when the unchanging personality of each member is combined with the new technology in the anime, something this amazing could really be done."
