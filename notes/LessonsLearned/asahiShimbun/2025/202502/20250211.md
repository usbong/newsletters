> 中国の人工知能（AI）開発企業「ディープシーク」の衝撃が広がるなか、留学経験がない「国産」のAI人材に注目が集まっている。中国は戦略的な人材育成に取り組んでおり、AIをめぐる米中の覇権争いに影響を与えそうだ。

As the impact brought about by "Deepseek," which is AI developed by China, grows, attention has centered on "locally produced" AI talents who have no study-abroad experience. China has been working on strategically growing its local talent, which has been influential in the battle between the U.S. and China on AI.

> 　1月末、米株式市場でAI関連株が急落した「ディープシーク・ショック」は中国でも大々的に報じられた。特に注目されたのは創業者の梁文鋒氏。春節（旧正月）に広東省に帰省した様子が報じられ、出身地区には「故郷の誇りだ！」との横断幕が掲げられた。中国メディアは、1985年生まれの「若き天才」が少年時代から成績優秀で、数学的な思考能力が高かったとする恩師の話をこぞって取り上げた。

At the end of January, the "Deep Seek Shock," which had caused the rapid drop in the value of AI-related stocks in the U.S. stock market, was widely reported. Its founder, Mr. LIANG, Wenfeng has, in particular, garnered considerable attention. During the Chinese New Year (which came after the New Year), his return to his homeland in Guangdong province was well celebrated, and he was praised in the streets as the "Pride of the Hometown!" China's news media picked up the master's story referring to him as the "Young Genius," who, born in 1985, was an excellent student since as a child and whose mathematical abilities were outstanding.

Other "geniuses" also received attention.

A key person in the development team is Mr. LUO, Fuli. By the end of last year, there was big news on this top talent from China's giant IT company, Xiaomi. He was reported to have been bringing in 10 million RMB (about 210 million yen) per year. Born in Sichuan province in 1995, Mr. LUO's father was an electrician, while his mother was a tutor of a typical home. 

One common thing with the two is that they both studied at local Chinese universities without having experiences studying abroad. Mr. LIANG was from the Graduate School of Zhejiang University-West in Zhejiang province, while Mr. LUO completed his graduate studies at the Graduate School of Peking University. Both are China's top experts in the AI field. According to the South China Morning Post, a Hong-Kong daily, DeepSeek is composed of 150 engineers, who're mainly fresh graduates from university and graduate school, and have little work experience. Also, many of the core members come from top local universities in China.

While there were many students from China who traveled to the U.S. to learn things like AI and Computer Science, the work that was started by the two "National Talents," who were trained locally in China, has shocked the world.

## The team that came back from abroad and the locally grown team are at the "same level"

"The AI talent who came back from overseas and the AI talent who've obtained their PhD's locally are of equal level. This has never been seen before."

There was an academic tech meeting on AI held in Shanghai, China in December of last year. Mr. YAO, Jiji who now works as the School President of Qinghua University, and has taught at prestigious universities like Princeton says that China has proved the idea that China "can provide enough" AI talent. Mr. YAO is a recipient of the Turing Award, the so-called Nobel Prize in the field of Computer Science.

In fact, a great portion of the world's AI talent comes from China. According to the Paulson Research Institute at the University of Chicago, in 2022, 47% of the best AI researchers who rank at the top 20% are from China, while the U.S. is at number 2 with 18%.

While the former Biden administration had formed a government body to establish a dialogue with China on the management of the risks concerning AI and advocate its safety, under the Trump administration, there's now a likelihood that the battle would be much fiercer. At the end of January, Mr. Trump announced a massive investment plan that puts a total of 500 billion USD in a span of four years into AI data centers. The administration has expressed the need to speed-up the process of rapidly building data centers, energy-generating facilities, etc. in order to compete with China, thereby increasing the sense of wariness against China even in the field of AI.

## "America cannot stop innovating"

On the one hand, China is strong. In the societal discussions section of a paper published by the Communist Party's Renmin Global Times last February 5, they pointed out that the arrival of DeepSeek "proved that a 'high wall in a small garden" cannot stop innovation." The U.S. administration emphasized that it doesn't have a way to strictly manage sanctions against China in a specific field. 

However, DeepSeek has been suspected of using U.S. semi-conductors that are export-restricted to China, as well as illegally obtaining U.S. data from Open AI. The U.S. administration, along with business entities, is continuing with the investigations. Also, it was pointed out that the limit of what was discussed pertaining to the sensitive issues that are censored in China and have yet no answer could prevent DeepSeek's proliferation. Actually, there has been a push by the governments of countries like Australia and South Korea to prohibit its use due to security and safety reasons. Meanwhile, there's also been attention given to the close proximity between its founder, LIU and LI, Qiang, a politician from China. Both had attended a meeting to listen to the opinions of various experts in fields like economics.
