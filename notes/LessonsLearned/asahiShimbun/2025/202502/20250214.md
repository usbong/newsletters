A girl who ran away from home was loitering under the Glico signboard in Minami, Osaka. She was taken to Tohoku region to be forced into prostitution. According to investigators, by the 13th of February, the Osaka Metropolitan Police has arrested two suspects with unspecified jobs, TAKIMOTO, Kaito (25) and NIIYAMA, Shunto (21), for having violated child welfare laws (forced fornication), kidnapping for profit and the Anti-Prostitution law. 

> 　捜査関係者によると、逮捕容疑は共謀して2024年6月15～25日、大阪市中央区のグリ下周辺で出会った家出中の少女（当時16歳）に「稼げる出稼ぎをしないか」などと持ちかけ、車で東北地方に連れて行き、現地のホテルなどに滞在させながら、複数の男性に対して売春をさせたというもの。

According to investigators, the arrested suspects colluded to ask a girl (16 years old at the time) who had run away from home and whom they met under the Glico area in Chuo District, Osaka City from June 15 to 25, 2025 if she'd "want to make money away from home." She was then taken to the Tohoku region in a vehicle, was made to stay in her current hotel address, among others, and was forced into prostitution selling sex to several men.

From the statement of the girl, among others, the Metropolitan Police finds that the suspects, including Mr. TAKIMOTO, were soliciting sex partners for females who were pretending to be adults at a dating site, in which the aforementioned girl was forced to have sex with over 100 partners in six prefectures in Tohoku and Niigata.

Moreover, the clients paid more than 1.5 million yen (approx. 750,000 PHP) in total, from which over half was taken by the two suspects.

## MORE

Subduing a person and forcing her into prostitution entail kidnapping through drug overdose, infliction of sexual harm and pornography without consent, among others. 

In recent years, there have been endless incidents of adults who've gotten involved with girls who loiter "Under Glico" and were targeted for sex-related crimes.

According to investigators, these girls felt that they didn't have a "place" at home, in school, among others, so they'd tend to gather under Glico in the hopes of finding a "friend" who is also in a similar situation. They are anxious mentally and economically, so this creates a way for adults with ulterior motives to come in.

"We've been asked if the girls could be offered an open space where they can feel at ease so as not to get involved in any untoward incident. Right now, for the girls, it has become a competition between the person with good intentions and another with bad intentions, and choosing which they'd find more welcoming."  

An expert on issues concerning young people gathering at "Tooyoko" in Kabukicho, Tokyo, which has a similar situation as under Glico, Tsukuba University Prof. DOI, Takayoshi (Sociology) has this to say.

In order to continue to loiter under Glico, it would be necessary to have things like money and a place to stay. What are they going to do to quickly make money?

"When the girls take this into consideration, they'd cling to an adult who'd let them borrow a room, which is where there would be incidents when they'd end up selling themselves through sex," says Prof. DOI. He continues that what becomes important therefore is a shelter that is run by the government.

## "The place where they can stay" provides over half of their needs.

At present, one of the basic things that can be done to offer support is to provide a place to stay near Glico. "DxP," a Non-profit Organization (NPO) in Chuo District, Osaka, assists young people through a "Use Center," which it has been running since June 2023.

Aside from free food, they offer a room in a building which they open from the evening until midnight, two times per week. People can come in to rest and also use it for their smartphone charging. Based on demand, the staff are also available for consultation. Since its opening, in a span of over 1.5 years, about 6,500 people have used the facility.

## However, there are many issues.

In a users survey (200 respondents) conducted by DxP, together with the City of Osaka, over half said that it provided the help that they wanted through "a place where they can stay."

A person-in-charge says, "While we'd want to address the needs of these young people, the current situation is that there are limits to our personnel as well as our funding. Even if we accept help from the government, they'd want detailed reports of our activities. There are users who don't want to reveal their names, and there would be many conditions."

Prof. DOI points out, "From the point of view of users who want a high degree of freedom, it can provide support, because it's open to the public. Still, it's important that the government takes the responsibility to create a hub that promotes cooperation among related organizations, as well as providing a back-up that is realistically economical."
