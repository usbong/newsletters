> 慶応大などの研究チームは13日、目の奥の網膜で光を感知する細胞がなくなって失明する目の難病に対し、新たな治療法の臨床試験を始めたと発表した。網膜に残っている本来は光を感知できない細胞に、「光センサー」のたんぱく質をつくらせ、再び光を感じられるようにするという。

The research team from Keio University et al. have announced on the 13th that they've begun doing clinical trials of a new medical treatment for blind patients who've lost the cells that can sense light inside the retina of their eyes. The team reported that the cells that originally couldn't sense light and still remained in the retina can be made to produce a "light sensing" protein in order to be able to sense light again.

> 　臨床試験の対象は、網膜色素変性症。光を感知する視細胞が失われて失明する。日本では4千～8千人に1人が発症するとされる。

The objective of the clinical trials is to address the problem of "retinitis pigmentosa." When the cells for sensing light are lost, patients also go blind. In Japan, one in 4,000 to 8,000 people are reported to have developed symptoms of the disease.

> 　視細胞は、隣り合う双極細胞を介して、光の情報を脳へと伝える視神経とつながっている。網膜色素変性症では視細胞がなくなっても、双極細胞や視神経は残っている場合がある。そのため、視細胞に代わって、双極細胞などに光を感知させることができれば、視力を回復できる可能性があり、研究が進められてきた。

The photoreceptor cells are linked to the optic nerve that transmits light information to the brain through neighboring bipolar cells. In retinitis pigmentosa, even if the photoreceptor cells are lost, there are still cases when the bipolar cells and the optic nerves remain. Because of this, present research has shown that if cells like the bipolar cells could be made to sense light, as a substitute for the photoreceptor cells, it should therefore be possible to recover sight.

What the research team focused on was the "chimeric rhodopsin," a type of microbe developed by Prof. KANDORI, Hideki of Nagoya Institute of Technology. Carrying the protein that responds to light, it can be modified to strengthen its ability to sense light.

> 　治療製剤は、慶応大発ベンチャーの「レストアビジョン」社が開発。製剤を目の中に注射すると、網膜を構成する細胞のうち、主に双極細胞に遺伝子が導入されてキメラロドプシンがつくられるようになる。マウスなどの動物実験では、光への感受性が回復することが示されている。

The medical treatment formula was developed by "Restore Vision," a venture from Keio University. When the formula is injected into the eye, and the gene is introduced into the cells that form the retina, particularly the bipolar cell, it becomes possible to produce the chimeric rhodopsin. In animal tests with mice, among others, it was found that this sense of light could be recovered.

> 　研究チームによると6日、慶応大病院で網膜色素変性症の患者1人の片目に製剤を注射した。患者は1週間ほど入院した後に退院した。今のところ、安全上の問題はみられず、今後も外来で経過観察を続けるという。

According to the research team, they injected last February 6 the drug in one of the eyes of a patient with retinitis pigmentosa at the Keio University Hospital. The patient was discharged after a week of being admitted in the hospital. At present, no problems in terms of safety have been observed, and it is foreseen that more observers from abroad will be continuing to come to make observations henceforth.

> 　今回の臨床試験の主な目的は安全性の評価で、同社によると、約1年半で6～15人に製剤を注射し、それぞれ半年間の経過観察をする。結果をふまえて、有効性を検証するために、より多くの患者を対象とした追加の臨床試験を実施するかを検討するという。

This time, the company says that the main objective of the clinical trials is to observe the progress of each of the six to 15 patients who've been injected with the drug in a span of about one and a half years to evaluate its safety. Based on the current results, they're considering adding even more participants in the clinical trials to prove its validity.

The genes that are the cause of the retinitis pigmentosa have been reported to number over 100. The current drug can bring back the capability to sense light if there are still bipolar cells that remain, even if the specific genes that are the cause of the disease cannot be identified.

During the press conference on the 13th, Keio University Assoc. Prof. KURIHARA, Toshide (Opthamology) says, "What we are aiming for is to move past the simple exclamation, 'It's shining,' and be able to get the patient to see that there's a cup here, a doorknob there as well as be able to walk in the street.

However, right now, given that we're still at the preliminary stages, we don't yet know how safe and effective this is. 

The technique of producing light sensing proteins like the "chimeric rhodopsin" in nerves, and to control nerve-related activities using light, known as "Optogenetics," can be a strong candidate for a Nobel Prize in the future. Activities to test its application as a form of medical treatment, and not simply as a research tool like this, are already being conducted, and countries comprising of at least America, France and China are doing clinical trials to try to apply Optogenetics in medical treatment using various methods.
