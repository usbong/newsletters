> 　単発で短時間の仕事ができる「スポットワーク（スキマバイト）」で、ひとつの企業が複数の仲介アプリを使うと、労働時間管理に苦慮する事例が出ている。雇用主の企業は労働基準法違反に問われる可能性があり、働き手は割増賃金を受け取り損ねる。企業は管理をアプリ事業者に頼るが、複数アプリを一括で管理する仕組みはない。「正確な情報やサービス提供には限界がある」と撤退するアプリ事業者も出てきた。専門家は「新たな法規制が必要だ」と指摘する。

There have been issues in the management of working hours when one company uses several instances of the "SpotWorks" app to measure "spot work," extra work that can be done in a short period of time. Employers may be questioned on its legality based on labor laws as well as incur losses from workers who're taking extra higher salaries. While businesses rely on the app provider in the management of this task, there's currently no way to manage multiple instances of the app in only one app. "There are limits to the accuracy of information and the services that a provider can offer," says the former provider of the app. Experts point out, "It's necessary to have new rules and regulations on the matter."

According to the Tsunagu Group Holdings, which has a site that provides employment consulting and recruitment, they found an incident where one worker has been using multiple instances of the app's "Short Works Today" service, such that one worker has clocked in over 40 hours of work per week, causing his working hours in the same company to go beyond 160 hours of work in one month. The company had come to Tsunagu Group Holdings to seek their advice.

According to basic labor laws, it would be necessary to pay overtime when workers are made to work over 40 hours per week, eight hours each day.

With regard to this, the Tsunagu Group Holdings says, "Since we let users manage attendance themselves, in the end, we cannot assist them in this matter," unless when it's a special case to respond to the needs of business users.

> 　労基法によると、労働時間を管理する責任は企業など雇用主にある。厚生労働省は、スポットワークの働き手も、管理責任はアプリ事業者ではなく、雇っている企業にあるとしている。

Based on basic labor laws, the responsibility to manage working hours is with the employer. The Ministry of Health, Labor and Welfare is saying that the management responsibility of SpotWorks users is not with the app provider, but with the company that hired them.

However, many app providers sell the idea of "managing the workforce" so that through their app, businesses could save themselves the trouble of doing this task themselves. In fact, there are many cases where the maximum weekly working hours and the monthly salary can be set by the worker who uses the app himself, so that the app provider would not need to shoulder the huge burden of micromanaging the workforce, which includes deciding on how much salary to increase as well as adding social insurance.

There have been plenty of workers who've gone beyond the maximum limit that has been set in the app in order to make a living using SpotWorks. Moreover, since there's no mechanism for the provider to manage the apps of other companies, as more app providers come in to join, delivering even adequate management service becomes especially challenging.

The Tsunagu Group Holdings stopped the "Short Works Today" service in its SpotWorks app in December of last year. Previously, in July 2022, it started a service to let users immediately receive their payments without additional face-to-face meetings; however, after 2.5 years, the service was shutdown. The head of the company says, "For many of our business users, managing the working hours in a single app seemed to have lost its meaning, especially when the number of app providers increased." Business users began to find managing its workforce complicated, considering that the legal risk involved in this also increased.

## Expert points out, "It's necessary to have new rules and regulations"

Prof. NUMATA, Masayuki of Hosei University (Labor Laws) explains, "When a worker, who uses a different app, works at a different department of the same company, it becomes difficult for a business to accurately obtain his working hours. While the responsibility falls on the company, it's necessary to understand the problem together with the app providers. In addition to taking into consideration the privacy of the workers, it's necessary to have rules and regulations that are concerned with the sharing of information, such as how long a person has been working, using whatever app it may be."
