>　ロシアから撤退した米マクドナルドの店舗や従業員を引き継いだ「フクースナ・イ・トーチカ」（おいしい。それだけ）で21日、「ハローキティ」のハンバーガーが夏メニューとして登場した。ウクライナ全面侵攻後も、ロシアではハローキティの人気は根強く、強い雨が降る中、大勢の若者らが列をつくった。

Last July 21, the "Hello Kitty" Hamburger arrived in the summer menu of "Vkusno i tochka (Tastes good. That's all.)," the fast food chain that took over the stores and personnel of McDonald's when the U.S. company withdrew from Russia. Even after the all-out attack on Ukraine, the Hello Kitty brand still remained widely popular in Russia. And even amidst the strong rains, many young people queued. 

>　ハローキティ・バーガーの大きな特徴は、ピンクのバンズ（パン）。同社が、ピンクがアニメの美学や斬新な食の象徴にもなっていると考える日本の文化から、着想を得たとしている。

The most striking feature of the Hello Kitty Hamburger is its pink buns (bread). The company has taken the idea from Japanese culture, which considers pink to symbolize art in anime and innovation in food.

>　モスクワ中心部の基幹店を訪れると、店舗の内外がキティや「バッドばつ丸」などで飾られ、キティのTシャツやグッズを身につけた人たちで混雑していた。

Visiting its main branch in central Moscow, I found the store's front and interior decorated with Kitty, "Bad Batsu Maru," and others. The place was crowded with people wearing Kitty T-shirts and miscellaneous goods.

>　注文用のタッチパネルもすべて、上部にキティの耳とリボンがつけられ、横ののぼりには「かわいいでしょう？」と日本語で書かれていた。

Even the touch panel used for ordering had Kitty's ears and ribbon on top, while on its side, a written Japanese text said, "Aren't they cute?"

Ms. Yana (17) who lives in Moscow says that Kitty's attractiveness comes from her being "very nice and beautiful. She doesn't have any malicious intention whatsoever." Her friend, Ms. Elizabeth (17), said, "The culture in Moscow moves toward Europe and the Americas, so it's really great to be able to know about Japan (its culture)."

In the main store branch, a place where photos can be taken with the Kitty doll and her illustrations have been put up, and a long, snake-like queue had formed during my visit. Photos taken using the smartphone could quickly be printed.

After the attack on Ukraine in February 2022, relations between Russia and Japan worsened with Russia pointing out that Japan is an "unfriendly country." Yet even now, Japanese culture which includes anime and manga is highly popular in Russia.
