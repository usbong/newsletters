>　先日、インドネシアで大学教員をしている友人から連絡があった。「フェイクニュースを信じる学生が多くて困っている。日本ではどう？」

I got a call from a friend who works as part of the university faculty in Indonesia the other day. "Many students here believe fake news. It's become a problem. How are things going in Japan?"

>　現地メディアによると、プラボウォ大統領らの偽動画がTikTokなど複数のSNSで拡散され、詐欺被害が多発しているという。

According to an on-site news media agency, fake videos of President Prabowo et al. have scattered all over several social media platforms including TikTok, creating a surge of fraud victims in its wake.

>　日本でも著名人が投資を呼びかけているとみせかけた詐欺が多発している。SNSをみると、著名人が手錠をかけられ逮捕されたように見える画像が確認できる。リンク先は偽のニュースサイトで、もうけ話に誘導され個人情報を抜き取られる恐れがある。

Even in Japan, there have been plenty of cases of fraud wherein famous people were calling on viewers to make some kind of investment. On social media, a posted image appears to be showing a famous person who had been handcuffed and arrested. In all likelihood, it would link to a fake news site where people could be lured into making money and also steal their private information.

Whether it's Indonesia or Japan, the fake images are believed to have been made using generative AI.

Generative AI has advanced so rapidly that it can now even handle a conversation while pretending to be a specific person.

According to a Japanese executive at US mail security policy firm Proof Point, in January of last year, there was a phone call from the president of a Japanese company. "I want you to send money immediately." While it was in the end found out to have been a fraud, the subordinate had believed that it was the real person up until the second phone call. The technology was able to faithfully replicate even the mannerism of the boss when he spoke.

In Hong-Kong and the UK, a similar trick has been shown to have duped people. Mr. MASUDA, Yukimi, the aforementioned company's Chief Evangelist, points out, "Criminal organizations have gotten passed the language barrier using generative AI." 

While I kept in touch with my friend who has worked as part of the university faculty in Indonesia, we haven't met in 10 years. During the video call, I immediately began to feel worried. I wondered if generative AI could be imitating the tanned skin and even the mouth that widens to the side when my friend smiled.

"I feel nostalgic about those days." A memory during our time at university was something only my close friend knew. The sense of nostalgia for people's memories and toward the past are things that would be difficult to believe to have been copied by generative AI.
