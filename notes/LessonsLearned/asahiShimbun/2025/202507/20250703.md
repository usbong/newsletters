>　生まれつき心臓の構造が正常と異なる先天性心疾患の手術に際して、3Dプリンターで作る心臓模型の使用が保険適用されたと、国立循環器病研究センター（国循、大阪府吹田市）が2日、発表した。模型を使った事前のシミュレーションによって、手術の精度や安全性の向上が期待される。

The National Research Center for Cardiovascular Diseases (Suita City, Osaka Prefecture) announced on the 2nd of July that the use of a model heart made with 3D printing technology to perform surgery of an abnormal congenital heart is now covered by insurance. The use of the model heart in simulations is expected to make surgery more accurate and safer.

The model heart was developed by the said National Research Center and Cross-medical (a company in Kyoto City). In 2023, it was recognized as a medical treatment device.

>　先天性心疾患はおよそ100人に1人の割合で発症する。心臓の構造が複雑なうえ、病状もさまざまで個人差が大きく、手術の難易度は高い。

Congenital heart disease occurs in about 1 in every 100 people. In addition to the complex structure of the heart, the symptoms vary greatly depending on the person and surgery can be very difficult.

The model heart was made based on patient CT scan data and used 3D printing technology. Because it uses soft material and is life-size, mock surgery to close a hole in the heart using needle and thread as well as connect artificial veins has become possible.

Dr. BANAI, Narimitsu from the National Center is the chief of the Prenatal Heart Surgery Department. He says, "Up until this point, surgery entailed using exam images to form 3D structures in the mind."

Because the technology makes it easier to plan surgical operations, it also correlates to the reduction in the time used in surgery, as well as lowers the physical burden on the patient.

This time, with its inclusion in the insurance coverage, the cost is also lowered on the side of the treatment facility. Visiting Researcher SHIRAIISHI, Ko of the National Research Center has been guiding the development of the technology. He says, "I'd want it to be more widely used so that heart surgery in small infants would become safer and more accurate."

Its inclusion in the insurance coverage began on the 1st of June. The Ministry of Health, Labour and Welfare has indicated 11 complex cases of congenital heart diseases for patients under 15 years old, and for whom heart surgery can be performed. In one year, there are as much as 700 cases expected to be reported.
