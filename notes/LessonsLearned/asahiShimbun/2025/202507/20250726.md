> がんの手術を担う消化器外科医が2040年時点で約5千人不足する見込みであることが、関係学会の推計でわかった。このままでは今のがん医療を継続できなくなる恐れがあるとし、厚生労働省は都道府県に対し、医療機関の集約化などの検討を求める方針だ。

Studies show that by 2040 there will be a shortage of about 5,000 gastrointestinal surgeons who'll be able to perform cancer surgery. As things stand right now, the current medical treatment would no longer be able to continue, so that the Ministry of Health, Labour, and Welfare of Japan is seeking a policy to examine aggregating treatment facilities at the prefecture level.

>　がんの診療体制を議論する厚労省の検討会で報告された。日本消化器外科学会に所属する医師は、長時間労働などで若手から敬遠され、減っている。この傾向が続くと、40年には9200人となり、25年の1万5200人から4割減ると推計された。40年には1万4400人の医師が必要とされ、5200人足りなくなる計算だ。

This was reported during a forum by the said Ministry who discussed the situation on the current cancer treatment system. Physicians who are members of the Japanese Gastrointestinal Society are decreasing, because young people distance themselves from it due to the long working hours. As this trend continues, by 2040, there will only be 9,200 surgeons, a 40% decrease from the 15,200 in 2025. A total of 14,400 surgeons will be needed come 2040, meaning that there will be a shortage of 5,200.

>　検討会が25日に大筋で了承した取りまとめ文書では、これまでと同様のがん医療提供体制を維持すれば、必要な医師数が確保できず「現在提供できている手術療法ですら継続できなくなる恐れがある」と指摘した。

In the summary document approved during the forum on the 25th of July, it was pointed out that if the same cancer treatment system is maintained, there won't be enough physicians in the coming future. "It's likely that the surgical treatments that are offered right now will no longer be able to continue."

Further, the document showed in particular that "an aggregated study is necessary," citing regions foreseen to have a shortage of physicians like gastrointestinal surgeons, as well as places where patients are few and specialists aren't enough. 

Taking into consideration the need for technologies that use high-costing equipment and facilities like those for use in radiation therapy, "we hope that data can be aggregated." 

Meanwhile, it was pointed out that in order for people to understand the need for the revision, "it would be vital that easy-to-understand explanations continue," emphasizing the goal of offering patients access to facilities used for their treatment.

Afterward, the Ministry of Health, Labour and Welfare notified the prefecture about the official summary document, and discussions were made at the council meeting using data pertaining to the required medical treatments and the number of patients available in the future. Prefecture officials turned their "Main Hospital connected to cancer treatment" into an office and joined the patients group as well as the cancer treatment providers of the region in the discussion.

According to the Ministry, when the number of cancer patients in 2040 is compared with the number in 2025, the value is expected to increase in 16 prefectures, and mainly in the city, while there will be a decrease in 31 prefectures. However, patients above 85 years old will increase in almost all regions except a small part that has been depopulated.

The impact of this is that among the three biggest cancer treatments, the need for surgery will decrease by 5% in 2040 compared with 2025, and the senior citizens who'll be undergoing high-costing radiation therapy will increase 25%, while those who'll be needing medicine will go up 15%.

According to the document, even in 2040, there won't be enough physicians who'll be performing radiation therapy. However, with the decrease in the population, high-costing equipment wouldn't need to be maintained in regions with lesser patients. 

As for treatment using prescribed medicines, there's no estimate yet if there will be a large shortage in the number of physicians. The document does point out that unlike surgery, patients will need to regularly and continuously undergo this type of treatment, and "we hope that it could balance out when combined with telemedicine."
