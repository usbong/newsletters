Two people went out, and could be seen to have suddenly fallen down one after another. The people nearby all ran away, while the taxi fled.

The two male victims died on the spot.

## More

According to the Japanese Embassy in the Philippines, after October of last year, there have been a total of 21 armed robbery cases involving Japanese nationals as victims in the Philippines. While "it's possible that foreigners including Japanese nationals are being targeted," the police are having a hard time narrowing down who the suspects are.

One of the "hurdles when conducting investigations" is that untoward incidents aren't reported to the local police. "Foreign tourists return to their home countries after a short period of time, and there are many cases where they refrain from submitting such reports to the police." The police reveal that "In the Philippines, it's difficult to arrest suspects if reports aren't filed." 

Guns circulating within the society also has a hand in this. In the Philippines, as long as the agreed requirements are met, even ordinary people can possess and carry guns. Right now, there are over 1.9 million registered guns, and there are more that are still unregistered. 

In the city, where the disparity between the rich and the poor has continued to widen, there has been a sudden increase in gun-related crimes that target foreigners. According to the statistics data of the National Police, the number of armed robbery, murder and physical injury, among other violent crimes that involve the use of guns has increased to over 4,900 cases in a span of one year in 2023.
