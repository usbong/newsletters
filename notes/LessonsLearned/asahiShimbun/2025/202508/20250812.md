>　世界的な人気を誇るポケモンカード。カードの発売日には店の前に長蛇の列ができることも。

Pokémon Cards have become popular worldwide. On the day that a card is to be released, the front of a shop in Tokyo has people lined up in a long and snake-like queue.

"Bright Day Shop 2" is a Pokémon Trading Card Specialty Shop that was established in Akihabara, Tokyo in 2021. From the day it began operations up until the present, it has kept with the rule that it would only sell to middle school students and below. What kind of thinking could have been behind this? We asked this question to Bright Day Shop 2's Mr. WATANABE, Sho, a YouTube personality who also goes by the name of "Tori-The-Shopkeeper."

>　ポケカは、1996年にゲームソフト「ポケットモンスター」に続いて発売され、累計製造枚数750億枚を超えるトレーディングカードです。その人気はいまや子どもだけでなく、大人にも広がり、うちのお客さんの6割ほどは大人が占めます。

The Pokémon Trading Card Game ("Pokeka") is a trading card game that follows the Pocket Monsters (Pokémon) Game Boy game of 1996 with over 75 billion cards having been printed to date. Its popularity isn't only among children, but now also includes grownups. Among my clients, grownups occupy 60%.

>　ポケカは、まず様々な種類のポケモンやアイテムのカードを集め、そこから60枚を選んで対戦して遊びます。ゲームと同じく相手のポケモン6体を倒せば勝ちというルールで、アニメやゲームの世界観を再現できるのが魅力のひとつです。

Firstly, in Pokeka, various types of Pokémon and items cards are collected, and from among those, 60 are chosen to be able to play the versus battle. The same with the game, the rule says that the winner is the one who knocks out  six of the other player's Pokémon's. One of the game's attractive features is that it recreates the world view of the anime and the game.

>　当店で遊んでいるのは、小学生から25歳くらいが多いでしょうか。年齢、性別問わず、対等に遊べるのもいいところです。一定の割合でレアなカードが入っていて、コレクションして楽しむ人も多くいます。イベントなどで配られた希少性の高いカードには、数千万円の値がつくこともあります。

Are there plenty of customers from grade school and up until about 25 years old playing the game at the shop? Regardless of age and sex, being able to play versus battles is also a good feature of the game. Many people also enjoy collecting the cards, where rare ones appear based on a set ratio. During events, there are also especially rare cards that are given out to participants, and their values would even reach several tens of millions of yens.

>　数年前から、カードがすぐ売り切れてしまう状況が起きるようになりました。遊ぶ人が急増して、カードの需要に供給が追いつかなくなったからです。スマホゲーム「ポケモンGO」の流行や、すぐに対戦できる60枚入り税込み550円の「スタートデッキ」が発売されたことが大きいでしょう。一部、買い占めたり、転売目的で買ったりする大人もいます。

Since several years ago, there are cards that have quickly sold out. As it turns out, players have rapidly increased, and the supply of the cards couldn't meet the demand. The popularity of the smartphone game "Pokémon GO" and the sale of the "Starter Kit" priced at 550 yen (tax-included ) and which already includes 60 cards that can be immediately used for the versus battle may have been the key factors that have contributed to this outcome. On the other hand, there are also grownups who've hoarded cards, and have bought them with the goal of reselling them.

>　そんな中でも子どもたちがカードを買えるように、当店では2021年の開店から、中学生以下だけが買える枠を設けました。平日昼間にカードが入荷すると、時間に都合がつく大人が買ってしまい、学校のある子どもたちが買えなくなってしまうようなことは避けたいと思ったからです。

This is why in order for children to be able to buy the cards, I've put out the rule that only middle school children and below would be able to buy them at the shop since we opened in 2021. If I displayed the cards during the day and on a weekday, the grownups who have the free time would buy them, and the children who have school won't be able to anymore. I wanted to avoid this situation.

I want children to feel the joy of opening the packs with the cards inside. It's the sense of excitement that one feels when he doesn't know what could be inside. It's the joy of finding out who from among the cards inside would be his friend. Children begin to like Pokeka even more because of this kind of experience. Even after they've grown older, they'd still enjoy the game. And if more generations enjoy it, its content also grows along with them.

In the shop, we've opened tournaments, which we've divided into three categories: grade schoolers and below, middle school students, parents and their children. Those who've participated in them have continued on with Pokeka for over 10 years, and I hope that there'll again be a new generation who'd come in. Meanwhile, I've been streaming information about the cards on YouTube for children.

In the past, toys had an image of being things that children played. But things that can be played at home like manga comics, anime and video games have increased. The people who've played those things when they were children have gotten older. They've still continued to like certain characters found in games, and I think that it's natural to go back to them with a feeling of nostalgia.

Even looking at the toy industry as a whole, I think that it's a good thing that both children and grownups could enjoy the game. I want to welcome all kinds of people who'd come together because of their love for the content. But it's not good that only the grownups with the spare money and the freedom who'd be able to enjoy it, while children are pushed out.

So that anyone could enjoy Pokeka, which means that not only its developers and the small shops, but also the players themselves, it's important to consider the future of the content while keeping in mind the idea of "trying not to go beyond one's share of the whole."
