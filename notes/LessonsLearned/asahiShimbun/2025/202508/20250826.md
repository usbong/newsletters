"I feel a bit more at ease that I'm not the only one, and that there are children from about the same grade level as I am who are here as well."

>　東京都八王子市の中心部にある市学校給食センター元横山。7月中旬、給食を食べに訪れた男子中学生はそう話した。この日、集まったのは保護者を含めて10人ほど。学校に届けられた給食と同じ、スパゲティミートソースと大根ワカメサラダ、フルーツゼリーを頰張った。


Motoyokoyama City School Cafeteria is located at the center of Hachioji City in Tokyo. A male junior high school student who had come to eat the school-provided meal in mid-July was the person who said those words. About 10 people, including the guardians, had gathered together on that day. They had the same food as the one that was delivered to the school. They ate food that consisted of spaghetti with meat sauce, daikon and wakame seaweed salad, as well as fruit jelly.

"Ah, cafeteria food!"

>　男子中学生は地元の公立小から中高一貫校に進学し、「百八十度、環境が変わった」。周囲は知らない子ばかりで、通学はバスと電車を乗り継いで30分。新しい環境になじめず、食事もとれなくなった。徐々に学校から足が遠のき、地元の公立中に転校した。「他にも色々あって、学校が怖くなって。なんだか疲れちゃった」

The male junior high school student continued his studies at an integrated middle-high school after graduating from the public primary school. "My surroundings changed 180 degrees." It was full of children who aren't familiar with the place, and it takes 30 minutes to commute to school riding both the bus and the train. Unable to get used to the new environment, the students also couldn't eat. Gradually, school became too distant, and they transferred to the public middle school located at their vicinity. "I felt tired somehow. I became afraid of school given how things are in my life."

>　小児科医の勧めで今年2月、母親（46）と一緒に初めて来た。「最初はドキドキしたし、めんどくさかった。来たら、おいしくって、『ああ、給食だ』って懐かしくて、うれしかった」

As advised by a pediatrician, in February of this year, the student's mother (46) went to the school cafeteria together with him for the first time. She said, "I felt nervous at first. It was too much of a bother. But after coming, I was very happy, the food was delicious and felt nostalgic: 'Ah, cafeteria food!'"

>　初日は半分も飲めなかった給食の牛乳。今はご飯やおかずも完食できるようになった。母親は、取り組みはありがたいという。「家だと食べるものが偏りがち。ここでは、この食材も食べられるんだな、などと色々見える」

On the first day, he couldn't finish even half of the milk. Right now, he's been able to finish the food as well as the side dishes. The mother says that she's grateful for this initiative. "We tend to be biased toward food at home. Here, we can learn all kinds of things like, for instance, there are food that he can now eat."
