> フィリピンに拠点を置く日系企業の社債購入を無登録で勧めたとして、金融商品取引法違反（無登録営業）容疑で逮捕された金融関連会社の経営者ら男女3人について、警視庁は27日にも詐欺容疑で再逮捕する方針を固めた。捜査関係者への取材でわかった。同庁は、経営者らが2016年以降に「莫大（ばくだい）な資産があるから、万が一倒産しても資産を売却して返済する」などと呼びかけ、約5500人から約460億円を集めたとみている。

The police have reaffirmed its policy against fraud on August 27 by again arresting three managers of a financial company due to violation of conducting illegal business transactions after it solicited the purchase of corporate bonds of a Japanese-affiliated business based in the Philippines. The managers had invited investors since after 2016 to an investment opportunity involving a company with "an enormous asset, which could be sold and investors' money returned in the rare chance that the company failed." They are seen to have accumulated a total of about 46 billion yen from approximately 5,500 people.

>　金融関連会社は「S（エス）　DIVISION（ディビジョン）　HOLDINGS（ホールディングス）」（SDH社）で、経営者は須見一容疑者（45）=兵庫県宝塚市。捜査関係者によると、須見容疑者ら3人は共謀して22年11月～23年2月、「フィリピンで展開する事業で多額の利益がありSDH社債の元本償還と利息の支払いには問題ない」などとうそを言い、社債購入名目で男性4人から現金計7300万円をだまし取った疑いがある。

The name of the aforementioned financial company is "S DIVISION HOLDINGS (SDH)." Its manager and suspect is Mr. HAJIME, Sumi from Takarazuka City, Hyogo Prefecture. According to investigators, Mr. HAJIME corroborated with two others from November 2022 to February 2023. He lied to investors when he said, "There's no problem in SDH's paying the interest and redeeming the principal, because it makes huge profits from its business development projects in the Philippines." Moreover, four men have been suspected of fraud where a total of 73 million yen in cash have been taken under the pretext of purchasing corporate bonds.

While the company was able to pay the interest at the start, payments had stopped since around February of last year. Other than SDH's business being non-existent, it also doesn't have the capability to pay via its so-called "enormous asset" and is actually running on a tight budget. The police are now investigating the case due to fraud.

With regard to SDH, the Osaka Trial Court has received the allegations filed by the Securities and Exchange Commission's Surveillance Committee in November 2023, and has ordered Mr. Sumi and the company to stop further soliciting the purchase of foreign corporate bonds without registration.
