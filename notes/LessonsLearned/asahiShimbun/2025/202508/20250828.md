The Aichi Prefecture Police has indicated that the videos seized from the suspects contain recordings of girls performing pornography. According to Mr. YAMADA, Norihiko, a researcher at the Asian Economic Research Center, with the rising commodity prices in Laos due to inflation in the past few years, children in poor areas are being sold by their parents to prostitution in the city.

After 2010, conversations about the experience of child prostitution in Laos have spread on social media, and Japanese travelers with that particular intention in mind have increased. While child prostitution is a crime even in Laos, bribery is rampant, and the local authorities are unable to control the situation. This is why exposing international crimes is considered as a "deterrent." They point out that "It's important that international institutions, other countries and NGO's pressure the government."  

Knowledgeable about kidnappings in Southeast Asia, Special Appointed Professor Dr. SAITO, Yuriko of the Daito Bunka University thinks that "Laos doesn't yet have a system to protect children, which is why there are plenty of cases where children are taken to be sold to prostitution."
