> 少子高齢化が進む中で、国民皆保険にどんな役割を担わせるべきなのか。社会全体が困難な選択に向き合い、熟議すべき大きなテーマだ。その場しのぎでは行き詰まる。中長期的に意味のある解決を目指すには、与野党が協議する場づくりが不可欠だ。

What type of role must the National Health Insurance take in the face of an aging population? This is a big topic that needs to be discussed, and where the whole community will have to make a difficult decision. It's here where we're stuck. In aiming to solve the problem in the mid-long term, it's necessary to create a venue where both the ruling party and the opposition can convene.

> 　医療費の患者負担に月ごとの上限を設ける「高額療養費制度」の見直しをめぐり、石破首相が政府案の再検討を国会で表明した。３段階で予定していた限度額引き上げのうち、今年８月の第１段階は実施するが、その後については今秋までに「改めて方針を検討し、決定する」という。

Concerning the revision to the "policy on high-costing medical treatment," which sets the maximum amount that the patient shoulders for medical treatment per month, Prime Minister ISHIBA has announced the re-evaluation of the said government policy during the National Assembly. The plan has been to raise the amount during the third stage, and that the first stage is to be implemented in August of this year, while during the fall of this same year, the policy is going to "be reviewed again to decide what happens afterward."

> 　その過程では、患者団体を含む関係者の意見を十分聞くというが、大きな影響を受ける当事者の声に耳を傾けるのは本来、当然のことだ。だが今回はこの点が全く足りず、患者団体や専門家から、制度見直しの進め方自体が拙速だと強い批判を受けている。

During this process, it's obviously important to listen to those who'll be greatly affected by the policy, and that the opinions of the stakeholders including the patients group are adequately heard. However, this part didn't turn out as well as it should in this case, and there's strong criticism from the patients group as well as the experts that the re-evaluation of the policy is being hurried.

> 　さらに気になるのは、首相が「増大する高額療養費を能力に応じてどのように分かち合うか」と述べたことだ。この制度の枠内でやりくりする前提にも聞こえるが、それでは解を見いだしにくい。より幅広い選択肢を並べて議論を深めるべきではないか。

What further needs to be emphasized is the question that the prime minister has raised: "How can the increasing cost of medical treatment be shared according to each person's capability?" While there appears to be a presumption to make ends meet within the bounds of the policy, it's difficult to find a solution. Wouldn't it be necessary to move forward with the discussions by listing a wider array of options?

> 　例えば、新年度予算案の修正で与党と合意した日本維新の会は、高額療養費の限度額引き上げには反対を表明する一方で、社会保険料の引き下げ策として、市販薬と効果やリスクが似る薬（ＯＴＣ類似薬）への保険給付を見直すことを重視している。

For example, while the Japan Restoration Party agreed with the ruling party to revise the budget for the new year, it expressed its opposition to increase the maximum amount that is shouldered by patients for high-costing medical treatment, and has been drawing attention to the re-evaluation of insurance payments, which cover over-the-counter medicines and those with similar effects and risks, in order to bring down the fees stipulated in the social insurance policy.

> 　高額療養費がカバーするのは、重い病気やケガの医療費で生活が破綻（はたん）しかねないような「大きなリスク」だ。それと比べれば、風邪薬や湿布など日頃使う薬の負担は「小さなリスク」かもしれない。ただ、より多くの人が恩恵を受けており、そこを削ることへの反発も予想される。

The high-costing medical treatment fees cover serious diseases and injury that are "big risks," because they could easily destroy a person's life. Compared to this, the cost of everyday medicines like those for colds or some kind of compress may be considered to be "minor risks." However, more people are benefiting from the latter that it's foreseen that taking away these from the current policy would lead to protests.

> 　教訓がある。立憲民主党の野田佳彦代表が首相だった民主党政権下の１１年、厚生労働省は、外来患者が受診のたびに窓口で１００円を上乗せして払う「受診時定額負担」を提案した。高額療養費の限度額引き下げのためだ。

There's a lesson to be learned during the time of Mr. Yoshihiko NODA of the Constitutional Democratic Party of Japan who served as the prime minister under the Democratic Party in 2011. The Ministry of Health, Labour and Welfare proposed adding 100 yen to the "fixed cost during diagnosis" that is paid when an outpatient comes for diagnosis. The objective was to lower the maximum amount shouldered by patients for high-costing medical treatment. 

> 　だが、日本医師会が「受診控えを起こす」などと猛反発し、「低所得者ほど負担が重くなり、格差を助長する」といった批判も出て、民主党内もまとまらず見送られた。

However, the Japanese Medical Doctors Association heatedly protested that "it'll discourage patients from coming for diagnosis." It was also criticized for "increasing the cost shouldered by low-income patients, which in turn increase the income gap even further." The Democratic Party bid this farewell, without being able to find a resolution.

> 　ことほどさように、医療をめぐる負担と給付の合意形成は難しい。様々な利害にどれだけ多くの政治家が責任をもって向き合うのかが、解決へのカギを握る。今秋にとどまらず、その先も見据えた建設的な議論につなげるべきだ。

As time goes by, it's difficult to reconcile the cost of medical treatment and the amount to be paid. However, the key to solving the problem is found in the number of politicians who'll take responsibility for the various pros and cons of the policy. Before fall comes, it's necessary to have a constructive discussion on what is foreseen to lie ahead.
