> 　ネットでスポーツ中継を見ていたら、オンラインカジノの運営会社の広告が流れてきた。日本では公営以外の賭博は違法なはずなのに、問題はないのか。

If you watch sports broadcasts online, you'll find that there are commercials from online casinos that come out. In Japan, other than state-run casinos, these are supposed to be illegal. 

> 　サッカーやプロ野球などスポーツ動画を配信する「DAZN」では、試合中継の合間にオンラインカジノ最大手「ベラジョン」などの広告を流してきた。

One case for example is "DAZN," which broadcasts sports videos of soccer and professional baseball matches. The company had shown ads from giant online casino company "Vera&Jon" during break intervals of the matches.

> 　実は、流れているのは、お金を賭けない「無料版ゲーム」の広告。ベラジョン無料版のサイトには、「超画期的なオンラインカジノ」「完全無料で楽しめちゃいます！」とある。

Actually, what they showed was a commercial of the "free version of the game" where a person won't make money. In the website of the free version of Vera&Jon, there are words like "Super Impressive Online Casino," "Let's enjoy completely free online casino!"

> 　消費者庁によると、たとえ「カジノ風」でも、お金を賭けなければ「あくまでゲーム」とみなされるという。

According to the Bureau of Consumer Affairs, even if "casino is used as the theme," people would consider the app as "only a game" if no money can be earned.

> 　DAZNジャパンは取材に、「無料版であること、違法の有料版に誘導されないことを前提に放映してきた」と回答。一方、「現在は基準見直しのため、配信はストップしている」という。

DAZN Japan responded, "For the free version, the commercials were shown with the premise that viewers would not be led to the paid version, which is illegal. Right now, we've stopped broadcasting the commercials to allot time for the rules to be reviewed."

> <b>「射幸心をあおらない」からOK？　いまは見合わせ</b>

<b>It's OK if "gambling is discouraged?"</b>

> 　テレビなどでも問題になっている。

The ads have become a problem even on TV, among others.

> 　テレビ朝日は2月25日の定例会見で、ベラジョン無料版の広告を2022～23年に放送していたと説明。「有料版に誘引しない、射幸心をあおらない」などの基準を満たしていたが、「総合的に判断し」、放送を見合わせたという。

TV Asahi explained in a meeting in Feb. 25 that the commercials of the free version of Vera&Jon were broadcasted from 2022 to 2023. While the commercials did fulfill basic precepts like "Not to lead viewers to the paid version," its broadcasts have been suspended after a "unanimous decision."

> 　BSテレビ東京は、20～23年にベラジョンと「ミスティーノ」、BS―TBSが21～23年にベラジョンと「遊雅堂」無料版の広告を放送したと公表。ニッポン放送も無料版の広告の「放送の実績がある」と発表した。

BS TV Tokyo has said that it broadcasted the commercials of Vera&Jon and "Mystino" in 2020 to 2023, while BS-TBS said that it broadcasted the free version of "YU-GA-DO" and Vera&Jon from 2021 to 2023.

> 　サッカーJ2の北海道コンサドーレ札幌は、無料カジノゲームサイトの運営会社とのスポンサー契約の見直しを含めて検討中だ。

Soccer J2's Hokkaido Consadole-Sapporo is currently examining the operations of free casino gaming sites, including reviewing their terms of sponsorship.

> 　オンラインカジノの多くは、マルタやオランダ領キュラソーなどで登録され、「合法」とうたう。しかし、日本では競馬や競艇など法律で認められた公営ギャンブル以外でお金を賭ける行為は違法になる。日本からアクセスして賭ければ刑法の賭博罪が成立。罰則は50万円以下の罰金で、「常習賭博」の場合は3年以下の懲役だ。

Many of the online casinos are registered in Malta and Curacao in Holland, where they are "legal." However, in Japan, the law on horse and boat racings says that they are illegal if they are not state-run and people can make money. There's a prison sentence for violations related to gambling if these online casinos are accessed from Japan and people make money. The punishment is under 500,000 yen, while the sentence is under three years for "habitual gambling."

<b>If the ads online were for medicines, they'd also be illegal. What about for online casinos?</b>

Regarding the ads, in the case of medicines, they would be illegal according to the Stimulants Control Act and Medical Devices Act (Pharmaceutical Devices Law), among others. However, according to the Ministry of International Affairs and Communications, there's no rule against online casinos, which include their paid versions. A spokesperson says, "Even if it was a free version that leads to the paid version, which in turn can be linked to a gambling addiction, it's not illegal. However, it is 'harmful information.'"

<b>Even Comedian Mr. YOSHIMOTO says, 'Since it had ads on the Internet..." </b>

There are also cases where the commercials became the "entry point."

In November of last year, there was an incident where the police investigated the documents of 10 people suspected of gambling in an online casino. A 40-year-old male from downtown stated, "I found the ads online."

Another incident involved Mr. TAKAHIRA, Kuruma, the "Reiwa Romanticist" comedian, who was reported to have used an online casino, and said in an apology video that "he didn't find the ads illegal given that they also appeared online."

Professor Emeritus TORIHATA, Yoichi (Financial Theory) from Shizuoka University is knowledgeable about the situation, and has pointed out, "The logic that it's a free version, so it has no connection with the paid version is a difficult problem." For example, when we see Vera&Jon's commercial of the free version, and searched it using our smartphone or PC, what comes out at the top of the list is the site of the paid version.

Online casinos don't need to have an establishment, and since people can easily register, businesses are in a disarray, putting money into the ads to acquire clients. Prof. TORIHATA checked a number of sites of the free version, and explained the gist of the terms of usage, "The data collected are used for market research and for soliciting clients to play the game or use the service." He says, "Playing the free version lowers the hurdle to play the paid version." For businesses that want to increase new user registrations, the free version's information of its registered users is invaluable. It's also highly likely that the information will be further used for their marketing campaigns, hence we must not see the app as safe just because it's free."

<b>"The risk of gambling addiction is high"</b>

In "A Community that Thinks about the Gambling Addiction Problem," Ms. TANAKA, Noriko said that she feels that consultations on how to make money are increasing due to the free version.

She pointed out, "There are plenty of people, mainly young people, who've gotten used to paying money in a smartphone game. It's in this same sense that people enjoy the free version. There are also examples of people being led to an illegal site without being aware of it. Thus, media and the influencers, among others, who show the ads have a big responsibility."

Consultations related to online casinos that her group visited increased rapidly after the COVID-19 of 2021. Before the COVID-19 in 2019, only eight cases were reported for the whole year. In 2023, there were 97.

If you have a smartphone, it's available 24 hours and for 365 days, so the risk of addiction is also high. Recently, it has spread to even high school students, among many others who are in their tens. "The money that can be borrowed by young people isn't much. This is why there are also people who join sketchy part-time jobs. It would be a huge problem if people do this just for fun."
