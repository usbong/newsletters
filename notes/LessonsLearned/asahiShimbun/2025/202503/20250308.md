According to the Bureau of Consumer Affairs, even if "casino is the theme," if money can't be earned, people would consider it as "just a game."

DAZN Japan responded, "If it's the free version, the commercials were shown with the premise that viewers would not be led to the paid version, which is illegal. Right now, broadcasting has stopped to give time to review the rules."

TV Asahi explained in a meeting in Feb. 25 that the commercials of the free version of Vera&Jon were broadcasted from 2022 to 2023. While it has fulfilled basic precepts like "It doesn't lead viewers to the paid version," its broadcasts have been suspended based on a "unanimous decision."

> 　オンラインカジノの多くは、マルタやオランダ領キュラソーなどで登録され、「合法」とうたう。しかし、日本では競馬や競艇など法律で認められた公営ギャンブル以外でお金を賭ける行為は違法になる。日本からアクセスして賭ければ刑法の賭博罪が成立。罰則は50万円以下の罰金で、「常習賭博」の場合は3年以下の懲役だ。

Many of the online casinos are registered in Malta and Curacao in Holland, where they are "legal." However, in Japan, the law on horse and boat racings are illegal if they are not state-run and people can make money. There's a prison sentence for gambling offenses if these online casinos are accessed from Japan and people make money. The punishment is under 500,000 yen, while the sentence is under three years for "habitual gambling."

Regarding the ads, in the case of medicines, they would be illegal according to the Stimulants Control Act and Medical Devices Act (Pharmaceutical Devices Law), among others. However, according to the Ministry of International Affairs and Communications, there's no rule against online casinos, which include their paid versions. A spokesperson says, "Even if it was a free version that leads to the paid version, which can be linked to a gambling addiction, it's not illegal. However, it is 'Harmful Information.'"

<b>Even Comedian Mr. YOSHIMOTO, 'Since it had ads on the Internet..." </b>

There's also the case that the commercials became the "entry point."

In November of the previous year, there was an incident where the police investigated the documents of 10 people suspected of gambling in an online casino. A 40-year-old male from downtown stated, "I found the ads online."

Moreover, Mr. TAKAHIRA, Kuruma, the "Reiwa Romanticist" comedian, was reported to have used an online casino, and said in an apology video that "he didn't find the ads illegal given that they also appeared online."

Professor Emeritus TORIHATA, Yoichi (Financial Theory) from the Shizuoka University and who is knowledgeable about the situation points out, "The logic that it's a free version, so it has no connection with the paid version is a difficult problem." For example, when we see Vera&Jon's commercial of the free version, and searched it using our smartphone or PC, what comes out at the top of the list is the site of the paid version.

Online casinos don't need to have an establishment, and since it's easy to register, businesses are in a disarray, putting money into the ads to secure clients. Prof. TORIHATA checked a number of sites of the free version, and explained the gist in the terms of usage, "The data collected are used for market research and to solicit clients for the game or service." He says, "Playing the free version lowers the hurdle to play the paid version." For businesses that want to increase new user registrations, the free version's registration information is invaluable. It's also highly likely that the information will therefore be used for marketing. We must not consider it to be safe just because it's free."

<b>"The risk of gambling addiction is high"</b>

In "A Community that Thinks about the Gambling Addiction Problem," Ms. TANAKA, Noriko said that she feels that consultations pertaining to making money are increasing due to the free version.

She pointed out, "There are plenty of people, mainly young people, who've gotten used to paying money in a smartphone game. It's in this same sense that people enjoy the free version. There are also examples of people being led to an illegal site without being aware of it. Hence, media that show the ads as well as the influencers, among others have a big responsibility."

Consultations related to online casinos that the said group visited increased rapidly after the COVID-19 of 2021. Before the COVID-19 in 2019, only eight cases were reported for the whole year. In 2023, there were 97.

If you have a smartphone, it's available 24 hours for 365 days, so the risk of addiction is also high. Recently, it has spread to even high school students, among others in their tens. "The money that can be borrowed by young people isn't much, this is why there are also people who enter sketchy part-time jobs. It would be a huge problem if people do this just for fun."
