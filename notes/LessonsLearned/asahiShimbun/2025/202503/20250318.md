> 　「カジノ」という言葉はイタリア語で家を意味するカーザに由来し、中世のベネチアが起源だという。屋敷でギャンブルに興じる貴族らを公衆の目から遠ざけようと、当局者がカジーニと呼ぶ小さな家へ転居させた（ペッカ・スルクネンら著『ギャンブルの何が問題なのか？』）▼

The word, "casino," comes from the Italian word, "casa," which means "house," and was said to have originated in Venecia during the Middle Ages. In their attempt to remove from public view the nobles who were fond of gambling at their mansions, authorities transferred them to a small house called "casini." (from Pekka Sulkunen, et al., "What is it with gambling that is the problem?") 

After over 700 years, the casino has become an illegal existence on the palm of people's hands whatever time it may be. People connect using their smartphone to the online casino where they can place bets in a game. According to the police, during their preliminary investigations, local users were estimated to have numbered to about 3.37 million, while the total amount of money gambled each year has climbed to about 1.242 trillion yen. 

Even if the casinos are based in a country where they are legal, the person will be violating anti-gambling laws if he gambles from Japan. However, almost all the sites that the police has investigated don't explicitly show that their usage is prohibited in Japan, and nearly 40% of those who've used them say, "We weren't aware that they're illegal."

Many who claimed to have not been aware that gambling is illegal reasoned, "There are pachinkos and state-run competitions in Japan." It may perhaps be because of this that overseas businessmen have thought, "Japanese people are easy targets."

Even if connections to those sites are blocked as a counter-measure, there are people who doubt its effectiveness. Given that people can easily find ways to circumvent it, updating the list of the blocked sites, among others, is time-consuming and laborious.

In the study, over half of those who've reported their gambling experience are in their 20's and 30's. They were first lured by the ads to the gambling site, and then couldn't anymore get themselves out. They would tell lies to borrow money. Once they become addicted to gambling, they're likely going to end up destroying their future. In any case, these are things that should not be lightly dabbled with by people.
