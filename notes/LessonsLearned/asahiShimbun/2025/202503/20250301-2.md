> 米アマゾン創業者のジェフ・ベゾス氏は26日、個人として所有する米ワシントン・ポスト紙のオピニオン欄について、「個人の自由」と「自由市場」を擁護する記事を毎日掲載し、これに反対する意見は載せないと表明した。米国のIT企業トップらが、規制緩和を掲げるトランプ大統領を支持する姿勢を強めているなかで歩調を合わせる行動だが、同紙のオピニオン編集長は新方針に同調できないとして、辞任した。

With regard to the Opinion column of the Washington Post, Amazon founder Jeff Bezos has announced on the 26th that the newspaper, which he personally owns, won't be including in its daily publications any opinion piece that goes against news articles that protect "Individual Freedom" and "Market Freedom." Top U.S. IT firms have been increasing their support of President Trump, who's been relaxing regulations. While this action aligns with the goals of the said paper, its chief editor has resigned due to being unable to adjust to it.

> 　ベゾス氏はX（旧ツイッター）の投稿で、同紙の従業員に向けて送った書簡を公表。オピニオン欄を変更する理由について「かつては、全ての視点を捉える幅広いオピニオン欄を読者の自宅に毎日届けることが新聞の役割だった」としつつ、「現在はインターネットがその役割を担っている」と述べた。

Mr. Bezos has shared with the public on a post on X (formerly, Twitter) a letter that he sent to the said paper's employees. With regard to the reason for the changes in the Opinion column, "In the past, it was the role of the newspaper to deliver to the homes of the column's readers each day a wide array of opinions that encompass all points of view," and said that "Right now, the Internet is taking over this role."

Mr. Bezos reiterated, "I support America, and am proud of it." He wrote, "A great part of America's success comes from the freedom that is present in each and every field, including economics. Freedom is logically practical, promoting innovation, discovery and prosperity." It is for this reason that he advocates ideas with this kind of theme.

According to Mr. Bezos, Mr. David Shipley expressed his resignation after Mr. Bezos showed to the Opinion column's chief editor the new policy. Since then, they've been looking for a new Editor-in-Chief.

Other than the Community Discussions section, the Washington Post's Opinion column has published articles that have been contributed by authors from outside the company, as well as those by columnists from a wide array of backgrounds, ranging from conservative to liberal. According to U.S. paper New York Times, Mr. Shipley advised Mr. Bezos, "The Washington Post should continue to publish articles that have diverse points of view." However, he resigned after his advice was not heard.

In 2013, Mr. Bezos bought the Washington Post, which was having administrative difficulties, and has since been managing the company. However, in 2016, during the U.S. presidential elections, when Mr. Trump was voted into office for the first time, the president-elect criticized news from the Washington Post about himself, and said that he's been thinking and thinking about regulating Amazon.

Even so, Mr. Bezos has been continuously changing Washington Post's policies. In October of the previous year, it had stopped itself from recommending any particular candidate in the presidential elections, and announced that it won't recommend any candidate henceforth. According to the said paper, Mr. Bezos stopped a publication in their Community Discussions section even though preparations were already underway to recommend Democrat and Vice President, Harris.

Along with this change in the Opinion column,  Marty Baron, former editorial chief of Washington Post, commented on the state of U.S. media, "It's sad and I'm tired of it." He has "no doubt" that media affect Mr. Bezos's Amazon and his space company, Blue Origin, and commented, "The Post's long-held value system is being betrayed for the sake of the interests of these businesses that are given priority over The Post." Meanwhile, entrepreneur Mr. Elon Musk, who's close to Mr. Trump, has expressed his support of Mr Bezos' decision, posting on X, "Bravo, Jeff Bezos!"

Speaking of IT giants, Meta (formerly, Facebook) is abolishing in the U.S. "fact checking," which verifies factual relationships in the contents of third-party posts. The four IT giants, including Amazon and Meta, are being sued by the federal government for Antitrust (Anti-monopoly) violations. They are perceived to be aiming to circumvent the rules in showing their closeness with the Trump administration.
