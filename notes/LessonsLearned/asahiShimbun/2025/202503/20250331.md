AM (Amplitude, or the oscillation of the wave) is where various informations such as the news and music are transmitted.

Its antenna is about 100m in height and needs a wide area.

Its wavelength is long at 200m to 600m. 

Its transmission goes around the contours of the mountain.

It's easy for noise to enter the transmission.

FM (Frequency, or the change in the number of frequencies in the wave) is also used to send information.

Its antenna is about 2m high, and is placed on top of the mountains or on towers.

Its wavelength is short at 3m to 4m.

It's easy to listen to FM inside buildings.

Its sound has a high quality.
