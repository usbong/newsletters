> 順天堂大学などの研究チームが、先天性難聴の原因になる遺伝子変異を修復する、新しい手法を開発したと発表した。マウスを使った実験で、この変異で引き起こされる細胞の異常を修復できると確認した。

The research team from Juntendo University, among others, has presented a new procedure that they've developed to repair genetic mutations that cause inborn hearing impairment. In an experiment with mice, they've proven that they can repair the abnormality of the cells that cause this mutation.

> 　先天性難聴は、1千人の新生児のうち1～2人にあるとされる。約半数は両耳に難聴があり、さらにそのうち半数ほどは遺伝子が原因とされる。

Inborn hearing impairment affects every one to two newborns in 1,000. About half of these have a hearing impairment on both ears, and further within this group, as much as half are due to their genes. 

> 　今回チームが注目したのは、原因遺伝子として最も多くみられるGJB2という遺伝子。変異によって、耳の中の「内耳」で、細胞どうしの結合が乱れてしまうことが知られている。これによって、内耳の音を感知する機能がうまくはたらかなくなり、難聴につながると考えられている。

The team focused on the gene called "GJB2," which is considered to be the gene that is mostly the cause of hearing impairment. Through mutation, the ties that bind the cells located "inside" the ears become disorganized, so that the sensors within the ears to detect sound do not behave as well as they should, leading to hearing impairment.

> 　チームは、難聴の「治療薬」として、人間に病原性のないウイルスを改造することに成功。内耳に注射することで、GJB2の変異を修復する特別なたんぱく質がつくられるようにした。

The team has successfully modified a non-pathogenic virus which can work as the "medicine" for the hearing impairment. Injecting it inside the ears, the team was able to produce a special protein that repairs the GJB2's abnormality.

> 　ヒトの培養細胞を使った実験では、このウイルスの作用で、28%の細胞のGJB2遺伝子の変異が正しく修復されることを確認した。マウスの実験でも、内耳の細胞どうしの結合の乱れが修復されることが確認できたという。

In an experiment using cultured human cells, the team verified that the use of this virus can successfully repair the abnormality of the GJB2 gene in 28% of the cells. Even with their experimentations with mice, they were able to confirm that it can repair the disorder among the cells inside the ears.

> 　研究成果は3月10日付で、米臨床研究学会が発行する医学誌「JCI Insight」に発表された（[https://doi.org/10.1172/jci.insight.185193](https://doi.org/10.1172/jci.insight.185193)別ウインドウで開きます）。

The results of the study was published on the 10th of March in the U.S. Clinical and Academic Research's Medical Journal, "JCI Insight" ([https://doi.org/10.1172/jci.insight.185193](https://doi.org/10.1172/jci.insight.185193)).

According to Assoc. Prof. KAMIYA, Kazusaku from the Juntendo University's Science Lectures on Ear, Nose and Throat and also a member of the research team, more experiments were done with mice afterward to prove that using this procedure, any degree of loss in hearing could be recovered. Right now, they are planning to begin clinical trials with hearing impaired patients who have the GJB2 mutation.

From this research study, it is hoped that the procedure would become a basic medical treatment for hearing impairment, and one of the ways to achieve "gene therapy" to repair or supplement gene functionality.

With regard to abnormalities of the gene, "OTOF," a mutation different from GJB2, clinical trials abroad have already begun in order to verify safety and efficacy.

However, comparatively speaking, there are fewer patients with hearing impairment due to OTOF, while GJB2 has the most worldwide. 

Among the several known GJB2 mutations, it was the R75W mutation, which was used in this research study in particular. The team says that the procedure can also be applied to repair other gene mutations. Assoc. Prof. KAMIYA of Juntendo University adds, "We're aiming to develop medical treatment that targets the mutations most linked to hearing impairment."
