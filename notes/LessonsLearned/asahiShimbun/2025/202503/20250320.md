Kyoto University's Center for iPS Research and Application (CiRA), which creates custom-made "My iPS cells," has made a press release on the 18th of March that they've opened a new facility in "Nakanoshima Cross," an advanced medical treatment hub based in Osaka City. The donation was made by Mr. YANAI, Tadashi, the Chairman and President of Fast Retailing, the company behind Uniqlo. It was named the "Yanai my IPS Production Facility (Y-FiT)."

> 　京大の山中伸弥教授は2019年、マイiPS細胞の構想を掲げ、25年の大阪・関西万博で披露するという希望を語っていた。当時、患者自身のiPS細胞をつくるには、品質の検査なども含め数千万円のコストと1年程度の時間が必要だったが、「100万円、数週間で提供できるようにしたい」と提唱した。

In 2019, Kyoto University Professor and the man who's been advocating the concept of My iPS cells, Mr. YAMANAKA, Shinya spoke about his hope to open the facility at the Osaka/Kansai Exhibit in 2025. At the time, it cost several tens of millions of yen, including quality assurance, and needed a year's time to produce the iPS cells of the patient himself, but now he says, "I want to be able to offer the product for 1 million yen and produce it within a span of several weeks."

> 　製造コストを下げるために、閉鎖型自動培養装置でiPS細胞を作れるように研究を進めた。無菌的に自動培養することで、厳重に無菌を保つための施設や管理コストを抑えることができるという。手作業によるばらつきをなくし、人件費を抑えられるようにした。

To lower the manufacturing cost, he continued with his research work to be able to create iPS cells using a method that can do closed-type automated culturing. Given that they automatically cultures cells aseptically, it's possible to control administrative costs and the facility to strictly maintain the area aseptic. In the end, they were able to reduce human-related expenses by eliminating disorganization caused by manual work.

The iPS cells could now be produced from the patient's blood and in a span of only three weeks. This 2019 objective was achieved just before the opening of the exposition. However, creating the iPS cells is not the only goal. Using these cells to medically treat human organs cannot be accomplished if they cannot be properly differentiated. Therefore, the current issue is the automation of the process of cell differentiation as well as the production of cells for use in medical treatment. The team is continuing with the research to develop medical treatment for incurable diseases.

CiRA's Mr. TSUKAHARA, Masayoshi, who is the chief of the R&D center, said, "The facility to automatically produce My iPS cells for clinical use with patients who have incurable diseases is now completed. We can now stand at the starting line."
