> 日本人の死因トップのがん。治療でとりわけやっかいなのが、がんが最初にできたところからほかの臓器・組織に移る「転移」だが、実はなぜ転移するかはよくわかっていない。京都大や名古屋大の研究チームは、がん組織内には、活性酸素種の一つ、過酸化水素が高濃度に蓄積する「ホットスポット」が存在し、そこから逃げるようにがん細胞の一部が分離、放出されることで転移が始まるとマウス実験で突き止めた。

Cancer is the leading cause of death for Japanese people. But what is especially perilous during medical treatment is that it's actually not very well-understood why cancer cells transfer to other organs from where they were first produced, or what is known as "Metastasis." The research team comprised of Kyoto University and Nagoya University have hit on a discovery while experimenting with mice, showing that within a cancer group, there exist one of the reactive oxygen species (ROS) and a "hotspot" that accumulates hydrogen peroxide in a high degree of density, and that it is from there that a portion of cancer cells separate, as they try to escape and get out, hence starting the metastasis.

The results of the research have been published in the English science magazine, Nature Cell Biology.

> 　ヒトを含む多くの生物は酸素を利用してエネルギーを獲得するが、と同時に活性酸素種が生体内にできる。活性酸素種が蓄積すると酸化ストレスが生じて細胞を傷つけるため、多くの細胞にとって毒ともいえる存在だ。がん組織は代謝異常などによって活性酸素種が特に蓄積しやすく、とりわけ強い酸化ストレスにさらされているとされる。

While living things, including humans, use oxygen to obtain energy, they also produce reactive oxygen species within their bodies at the same time. When reactive oxygen species accumulate, oxidative stress is produced and harm the cells. This, for many of the cells, can be poisonous. A cancer group can accumulate these reactive oxygen species easily through metabolic disorder, among others, and further increase oxidative stress.

> 　研究チームは、1個の細胞レベルで外部の活性酸素種を直接的に検出する手法を開発。ヒトのがん細胞を移植したマウスで、がん組織の内部を観察したところ、過酸化水素の分布は不均一で、濃度が局所的に高いホットスポットが存在。その部分にさらされたがん細胞ではがん組織から分離、放出されることが活発に起きていた。関連する遺伝子の働きからも確認された。

The research team has developed a way to directly detect foreign reactive oxygen species at the cellular level per cell. In the mouse where a human cancer cell was transferred, the distribution of hydrogen peroxide was found to be uneven when the cancer group was observed. Moreover, they found that there was a high-density hotspot inside. The cancer cells that were exposed to that part became eager to get out, and eventually separated from the cancer group. This observation has also been verified in the function of related genes.

> 　さらに詳しく調べると、免疫細胞の一種である好中球がこのホットスポット周辺で集まっていることも観察された。好中球をがん組織から取り除くと過酸化水素のホットスポットがつくられにくくなった。

Upon further investigation, the neutrophil, a type of immune cell, was also observed to gather around this hotspot. When the neutrophils are removed from the cancer group, it became harder to create the hydrogen peroxide hotspot. 

> 　これらのことから、がん組織に集まった好中球が過酸化水素をつくってホットスポットを形成し、それにさらされたがん細胞が有害な過酸化水素から逃げるように分離、放出されることで転移が始まると考えられるという。

From this, it was learned that the neutrophils that gathered in the cancer group created the hydrogen peroxide and formed the hotspot. The cancer cells that were exposed to this hotspot separated in their attempt to escape from getting harmed by the hydrogen peroxide. This is considered to be what starts the metastasis.

### MORE

Among the variety of cancer cells, there's also a type that is strong and has an anti-oxidization effect, which hinders the functionality of the reactive oxygen species. These cancer cells were found to have the tendency to be a lot harder to separate and get out.

The research team used this mechanism to develop a drug to control this transfer (metastasis) by removing only the reactive oxygen species that become the cause for the separation and the release of cancer cells to other organs.

Assoc. Prof. Takahashi, Shigenari of Kyoto University (Medical Chemistry) says that "to escape" is the most fundamental defense mechanism that any living thing has, yet he was surprised to find out that the cancer cells were also fleeing. He said, "If an environment where there won't be a need for cancer cells to 'escape' could be created, it would be possible to prevent metastasis from occurring."
