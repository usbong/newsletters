Aside from selling a U.S.-made gold colored smartphone costing 499 USD (26,946 PHP), the company will be putting the phone in U.S. call centers. Donald Trump Jr., Trump's son, manages the Trump Organization and has commented, "Based on the idea that America is Number One, we are providing a high level of quality in our products and services."

With the Trump Organization as its core, Trump's family has been developing a wide array of businesses including Hotel Management and Crypto assets.
