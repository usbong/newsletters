> 世界最大級と言われるアダルトサイト「Pornhub（ポルノハブ）」の運営会社は4日、フランスで公開している三つのサイトを停止した。巨大IT企業への規制を強める欧州で、フランスは未成年者の保護を目的に、利用者の年齢確認を法律で厳格化。運営会社は反発している。

The managing company of the world's largest adult site, "Pornhub," has stopped the public viewing of its three websites in France this June 4. As Europe strengthens regulations against the large IT company, France has been applying stringent measures in accordance with the law to verify the age of the users of the sites with the objective of protecting minors. The said company is currently in protest against these measures.

> 　フランスで公開が停止されたのは、「アイロ（カナダ）」が運営するポルノハブなど3サイト。4日午後以降、サイトにアクセスしても開けなくなった代わりに、フランスの画家ドラクロワの「民衆を導く自由の女神」の絵などが表示されるようになった。「抗議」の意思を示したとみられる。

In France, the three sites that were stopped from public viewing are the sites managed by "Aylo (Canada)," which includes Pornhub. Since the afternoon of June 4, a painting of the "Goddess of Freedom who Guides the People" by French Artist Delacroix, among others, are shown whenever the sites are accessed. This is instead of the sites not opening at all. The action is considered to mean a sign of "Protest."

> 　多くのアダルトサイトが、サイトのアクセス時に、自己申告で「18歳以上か」などを選ばせる形で、年齢確認をしている。しかし、これでは不十分だとして、フランスは今年、すべてのアダルトサイトを対象に、利用者に成人であることを証明させるため、クレジットカードや身分証明書などでの年齢確認を義務づける法律を施行した。

Many adult sites verify the person's age by way of letting the user choose from among the choices that he is "above 18 years old" and the like when he accesses the site. However, given that this is no longer sufficient, France has implemented a law that requires all adult sites to verify user age using his credit card or ID to show proof that the person is indeed an adult. 

> 　これに対して、運営会社は反発。機密性の高い個人情報を扱えば、ハッキングや情報漏洩（ろうえい）の危険にさらされる可能性があるとし、年齢確認は、別の方法で行われるべきだと主張している。

The company has protested against this move. When handling information that is highly private and confidential, it emphasized that another method should be implemented to verify user age given that there's the possible risk of hacking and information leakage.

Stricter age verification is a "death sentence to the business"

The sites that Aylo manages have been fundamentally designed to be freely viewable and are built through the income it obtains mainly from its ads. According to French paper Le Monde, it's not only France. There are also states in the U.S. where public viewing of the said sites have been stopped after passing a law that requires user age to be verified. However, the company believes that stricter age verification is "equal to a death sentence to the business." 

According to France's Digital Regulatory Board, each month there are 2.3 million minors who access the adult sites, a number that has been rapidly increasing since the past few years.

The EU, to which France is a member, has also been strengthening regulations against adult sites. In May, investigations have begun against four sites, including Pornhub, with penalties also in sight due to the age of its users isn't sufficiently verified.
