> 　千葉・佐倉一高（現佐倉高）時代は無名だったが、立教大で通算本塁打8本の東京六大学野球記録（当時）を作り、注目を集めた。1958年に巨人に入団。デビュー戦で国鉄（現東京ヤクルトスワローズ）の金田正一投手（故人）に4打席4三振を喫したが、1年目から活躍、新人王に。昭和天皇ご夫妻が観戦した59年6月の阪神タイガース戦（後楽園球場）で、村山実投手（故人）からサヨナラ本塁打を放つなど、記憶に残る数々のプレーで「燃える男」と呼ばれてファンを魅了した。

While practically unknown during his time at Sakura Ichi High School in Chiba, he garnered attention after having made a total of eight home runs, a record (at the time) in the Tokyo Six University Baseball. In 1958, he joined the Giants. While he struck out four times in four battings due to Pitcher Masaichi Kaneda (RIP) of the National Steel (now the Tokyo Yakult Swallows) during his debut battle, he remained active from his first year onward until he was hailed the new king. During the battle with the Hanshin Tigers (at the Korakuen Baseball Stadium) in June 1959 and which was viewed by the Showa Emperor and his wife, he hit a Sayonara Home Run, among others, from Pitcher Minoru Murayama (RIP), leading to his getting called the "Burning Man" and attracting fans with his numerous memorable plays.

In 1975, he was appointed as Director of the Giants. In the beginning, the team placed last, but the following year, in 1976, they became the league's champion, among others. Even though the team won the league's championship two times, he resigned from directorship in 1980 without the team ever becoming The Best in Japan. He was later entered in the Baseball Hall of Fame in 1988.

In 1993, he returned as director. At the start of 1994 during the first ever tie breaker in the final fight, they won the league's championship after bringing down the Chunichi Dragons. They then defeated the Seibu Lions in the Japan Series to become The Best in Japan for the first time after his appointment as director. Even in 2000, they brought down the Daiei (now the Fukuoka Softbank Hawks) led by Director Sadahara Oh, winning The Best in Japan. He became the Giant's Lifetime Honorary Director when he retired from directorship after the 2001 season. As director, his track record in the span of 15 years since he took the helm was at 13th place in recorded history with 1034 wins and 889 loses in 59 divisions.

In 2002, he became advisor to the All Japan Baseball Association, and was appointed to be Japan's National Director. In the fall of 2003, the national team won during the Asian Championships, and he decided to participate in the 2004 Athens Olympics. However, in March of the same year, he collapsed due to a Cerebral infarction (stroke), and gave up the helm for the said Olympics, while he worked hard on his rehabilitation. 

He was appointed as Executive Advisor in the Japan Olympics Committee (JOC), among others, and became active outside the world of baseball. In 2001, he was awarded the Asahi Sports Prize. In 2005, he was chosen to receive the Cultural Merit Award. In 2013, he was awarded, along with former Big League Athlete Mr. Hideki Matsui, a student of his during his time as Director of the Giants, the People's Honor Award.
