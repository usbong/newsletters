> 　フィリピンのテオドロ国防相が1日、訪問先のシンガポールで朝日新聞などのインタビューに応じた。中国が海洋進出を強める中、「より強靱（きょうじん）でグローバルな同盟や多国間連携を築き、違法で一方向的な行動に共同で抵抗する必要がある」と強調。日本の中谷元・防衛相が提唱した「OCEAN（オーシャン）」構想に協力する考えを示した。

Philippine Defense Minister Teodoro was interviewed by Asahi News, among others, during his visit to Singapore on the 1st of June. Amidst China's stronger maritime advancements, he emphasized the "necessity to protest together against behavior that is one-sided and illegal through the formation of an even stronger global alliance among many nations." He expressed a cooperative stance toward the "Ocean" Way, which was proposed by Japanese Defense Minister NAKATANI, Gen.

> 　テオドロ氏はシンガポールで同日閉幕した「アジア安全保障会議（シャングリラ・ダイアローグ）」（英国際戦略研究所主催、朝日新聞社など後援）に参加した。日本の中谷防衛相やヘグセス米国防長官らと会談。日米豪比の4カ国会談も開かれた。

Mr. Teodoro joined the "Shangri-La Dialogue: Conference on Safety and Security in Asia (organized by the International Institute for Strategic Studies, and sponsored by Asahi News, among others)," which concluded on the same day in Singapore. Japanese Defense Minister NAKATANI and U.S. Defense Secretary Hegseth, among others, met to discuss issues related to the four nations namely Japan, U.S., Australia and the Philippines.

> 　フィリピンは南シナ海のスプラトリー（南沙）諸島などの領有権をめぐり、中国との間で緊張が激化している。「我々が進むべき方向は明確だ」。インタビューでテオドロ氏は、同盟国の米国とともに、より多くの国との安全保障協力を強化していく意向を示し、「その変化の責任は中国にある」と批判した。

Concerning the Philippines' territorial rights toward the islands, including the Spratly Islands, in the South China Sea, tension between the country and China is getting even more strained. "The direction to which we're headed is clear." During the interview, Mr. Teodoro said, "China is held responsible for the change," expressing his intention to further strengthen cooperation among even more nations, which include the U.S., on safety and security.

> 　その上で、日本との関係について、「（東シナ海や南シナ海で）共通する現実に直面している」と指摘。「中国の拡張主義に悩まされ、自然災害のリスクにさらされている。日本と協力できることは幸運だ」と述べた。

In addition, with regard to the country's relationship with Japan, he pointed out, "We face a common reality in the East and South China Seas." He said, "China's expansionism worries us. Our nations are also exposed to the risk of natural disasters. We are fortunate to be able to work together with Japan on these issues."

With regard to the Ocean Way, a concept that promotes the strengthening of relations and cooperation among nations who have shared values, Mr. NAKATANI found that "It's essential to have a safety and security alliance that goes beyond Europe, among other regions." The four nations, JP-US-AU-PH, have promised "to lead virtuously," showing a cooperative stance, where "even more support can be obtained through the formation of an international order based on rules and laws."  

Also, he spoke about his view on the "Trump Tariffs," which have created an issue in ASEAN due to America's imposition of high tariffs on each of its member nations.

Pointing out its impact in the increase in defense expenses, "We cannot deny its repercussions in our policies pertaining to the economy and safety and security, among others," adding his concern that "A military strategy without capital only amounts to an empty dialogue."

He spoke about negotiating with the U.S. on the topic saying, "It's necessary to propose a package that leads to mutual benefit between the U.S. and ASEAN."
