>　受験生のみなさんは、受験勉強も佳境の時期だと思います。苦しい時はぜひ、入学後のキラキラした学生生活ややりたいことに挑戦している自分を想像してください。

I believe that now is the crucial time to be studying for the entrance exams. During times of hardship, please imagine yourselves living the glamorous student life that you'll be enjoying upon entering university and taking on the challenges that you'd want to face.

>　2歳でバイオリン、5歳でピアノを始めました。「歯磨き、ご飯、バイオリン」というくらい、弾くのは当たり前で、一生続けるものと自然に思っていました。大分から福岡や東京の先生にも習いに行っていました。

I began the violin when I was two years old, and the piano, when I was five. "Brushing my teeth, eating, playing the violin." The last one was so natural to me that I thought that I'll be continuing on with it my whole life. For the most part, I went out to learn from teachers in Fukuoka and Tokyo. 

>　行き当たりばったり、いつも目の前のことを楽しむ方なので、音大進学を勧められることはありましたが、高校に入っても音楽の道へ進むとか東大をめざすとか考えなかったですね。塾に通ったこともないから、偏差値には無縁でしたし。

As a person who simply goes with the flow and just enjoys what is right in front of me, I was advised to go to music school for further studies. However, I didn't really think about whether to go to music school or aim for the University of Tokyo when I entered high school. I had never gone to a review center, and this wasn't because I'm deviant.

>　母も楽観的で、何を相談しても「OK!　いいんじゃない」と。「そんなのあたり前田のクラッカー!」とギャグで返され、進路をとやかく言うこともなかった。

My mother, also being optimistic, encouraged me with, "OK! Isn't that great?" whenever I talked to her about these things. She'd crack up a joke like "That's obvious as rice crackers," without telling me which path to take.

>　「この大学へ行きたい」と思ったのは、県立大分上野丘高校2年の時。思い切って応募した海外オーディションで勝ち取った全米ツアーの後、せっかくだからと大学のキャンパスも巡りました。その時、ハーバード大学でいろんな活動をする学生たちを知り、「ここなら音楽も学業も両立できるかも」と思ったんです。

I was in sophomore year at the Oita Ueno Public High School when I thought that "I wanted to go to Harvard." After a nationwide U.S. tour, which I won by taking the leap and auditioning overseas, I went around and visited the university campus thinking that I might as well, given that I was already there. At the time, I met students who were involved in various activities at Harvard University. I thought that "I could do both academics and music together if I studied here."

>　高校の先生も友達も海外大進学の知識はないし、ネットで調べて、そこから記憶にないほど猛勉強しました。英語は、物心ついた時からクイズ感覚で楽しんで、勉強という感覚はあまりありませんでしたが、受験では苦労しました。

My high school teachers and friends didn't know much about pursuing higher education abroad, so I searched online, and studied harder than I ever had from that point onward. Since as far back as I could remember, I enjoyed studying English for the quiz-like feel to it, which felt like I was hardly studying at all. However, I struggled with this subject when I took Harvard's entrance exam.

>　米国のSAT（大学進学適性試験）で入学できる高得点を取るには、2万語の英単語を覚えなきゃならない。「10分間で50語覚える」とタスクを決めて、必死で覚えました。タイマーをかけて、時間で区切らないと、いつまでもかかっちゃって勉強の精度も上がらないので、時間を区切ることは心がけていましたね。

To be able to get outstanding SAT marks that would be high enough to let a student enter the university, he must remember 20,000 English vocabulary words. I did this task diligently once I decided to take on the challenge of "memorizing 50 words in 10 minutes." Failing to mark my time with a timer wouldn't improve my academic performance, because I'd end up taking too much time answering, so I made sure that I took note of my time well.

>　あと、出題も英語なので、数学の「階乗」などの用語や世界史の「チンギス・ハーン」などの人名の表記を英語で覚えるのも苦労しました。

Next, because the questions were also in English, I struggled with memorizing special math vocabulary, which included words like "factorial," as well as the list of names that noted famous people like "Genghis Khan" and others.

>　米国の大学入試は日本と大きく異なり、受験で重視されるポイント、各科目での文化の違いなど、目からうろこでした。

The university entrance exams in the U.S. are very different from those in Japan, especially in terms of the areas that the exams focus on, and it was an eye-opener for me to learn about the cultural differences present in the subjects.

Taking the entrance exams at the local universities too

Since I was enrolled in the University of Tokyo's literature class during high school, I had to take reviews for the second part of the university's exam. While I'm not good at waking up early, I still managed to go to class. After which, my friend and I would remain inside the classroom and teach each other the subject matter. We'd finish the homeworks in school. When I returned home, I'd play a little bit of violin, and would study until late in the evening. For about half a year, I didn't have any more time to play the violin.

There are so many things that I'd want to do at Harvard, and while I often mused about those things, I didn't really think that I'd pass the entrance exam, so I took Keio University's entrance exam to get into its Department of Policy Studies. By December, Harvard University sent out the list of names of the passers who submitted their applications early. However, I still took the entrance exam at Keio University, because we were told that everyone at our high school had to take the general entrance exam. This is why I went to Keio University until I moved to the United States in the fall. If I didn't pass Harvard University, I'd probably submit an application at another university in the U.S. when the new year began.

At Harvard, I majored in Applied Mathematics during my sophomore year after a friend invited me. I thought that I could study something that combined together number sequences and music. But I felt that it was a little different from what I imagined, so I shifted to Sociology during my junior year. It was in senior year when I majored in Music and minored in Global Health. I believe that people can grow their potential up to 200%, so we should all take on more and more challenges that interest us.

At Harvard, there are actually people who raise their hands and are very opinionated. They actively speak out and discuss things with each other. At the dining hall, people talk about various issues using technical vocabulary, and I thought that "they sounded interesting."

"Don't create limitations for yourself."

Other than academics, there are plenty of things to do at Harvard, and I myself was active in four organizations, namely Student Opera, Percussion Ensemble, Orchestra and Japan Society. In the Orchestra, I was thrilled to go out and perform in Jordan and Israel.

Afterward, I wanted to take a proper music education so much that I went to the New York Juilliard School of Music for graduate school. I was happy to be able to study in an environment where I could perform continuously from morning to evening. The streets were also different from Boston's so I was again thrilled to go out and be there.

I'd like to tell people who are considering taking the entrance exam, or those who'll be taking it soon, that they shouldn't create limitations for themselves. Anything is possible.

As a result, even if you don't get into your first choice, I think that there's definitely a way to improve your present condition. It's not all about the university's ranking, nor its affiliations after all. In other words, your aim should be global. While one of you may have won an award at an International Pokémon Trading Card Game Tournament, the point is that you should have something that you can communicate with the world other than academics.

There might be people who've given up after getting no encouragement to go to music school. But music is something that you actually pursue your whole life; it isn't something that you can't do alongside another academic field. In Akita International University, there are classes that teach "Music x Brain," "Music x Education," "Music x something" that are based on "Macro Music."  While specializing in music is wonderful, there's also a way to combine multiplication with music.

Even if studying for the entrance exams has no particular impact on me right now, studying at the university and being able to meet friends there have.

To all who'll be taking the entrance exams, "Anything is possible!!"
