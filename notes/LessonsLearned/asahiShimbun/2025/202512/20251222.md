>　働きアリたちに実母の女王アリを殺させて巣を乗っ取る――。「寄生アリ」のそんな寄生先での女王アリ排除方法を、九州大学などの研究チームが新たに発見した。きっかけは、アリ愛好家の粘り強い観察。地中にいる女王アリの実態解明は容易ではなく、九州大の研究者はこの貴重な発見について「アリを酔狂のように愛している人がなせる業」と話す。

The worker offspring of the queen ant are made to kill their actual mother so that an intruder, another queen ant, could take over the nest. This way of killing the queen ant by another queen ant was newly discovered by the research team at Kyushu University, among others. The keen observation of ant enthusiasts has led researchers to an invaluable discovery. They say that it's "a job that can only be done by crazy ant enthusiasts," especially because bringing to light the queen ant's actual circumstance inside the soil isn't easy.

>　学術誌「カレント・バイオロジー」に11月17日付で論文が掲載された（https://doi.org/10.1016/j.cub.2025.09.037別ウインドウで開きます）。九州大の高須賀圭三助教（生態学）によると、寄生者が自身の利益になる行動を寄生先に強制する「寄主操作」のなかで、子を操って母殺しをさせる現象は生物学史上前例がないという。

The paper was published last November 17 in the academic journal, "Current Biology" (https://doi.org/10.1016/j.cub.2025.09.037; last accessed: 20251222). According to Assist. Prof. Keizo Takasuka (Ecology), there's no prior example in the history of biology where the offspring are controlled and made to kill their mother through a kind of "parasitic control" that is forced upon them by another queen ant for the sake of her own benefit.

The queen ant is known to continuously give birth to worker ants in her nest. However, it's been found that there's a type of queen ant that kills another queen ant by sneaking into her nest, and then makes the worker ants raise her own offspring in that nest.

This method of killing the queen ant was hardly known prior to this discovery. Previously, the only known way was for the queen ant to bite off the neck of the other queen ant, whose nest she wants to take over.

Mr. Taku Shimada from the Mail Order Ant Specialty Store, "Ant Room," in Tokyo discovered this new method of taking over another queen ant's nest. In August 2021, he had gone with Mr. Towa, his eldest son who was 9 years old at the time (now 14), to the mountains of Yamanashi Prefecture in order to collect ants. During that time, Mr. Towa chanced upon a queen ant on the open surface of the soil. Normally, the queen ant would be in her nest inside the soil; however, on this occasion, what he found wasn't just any type of queen ant. It was a Lasius orientalis queen ant, the type that kills other queen ants.

Researchers were "so shocked that they were speechless" when they saw this discovery on Mr. Shimada's blog.

How does the Lasius orientalis queen ant kill the other queen ant? Curious, Mr. Shimada brought home the queen ant and put it in a yellow ant's nest. So as not to miss any moment, he continued with his observations on top of a table inside his living room.

The Lasius orientalis queen ant came near the other queen ant and blasted her stomach with a type of liquid that is believed to be formic acid. This acid, a liquid with a stimulating smell, incited the target queen ant's fellow ants to attack their mother, while also dulling her movement, among other things. 

The moment the queen ant was blasted, the worker ants crowded around the mother queen ant and bit her until they finally killed her. Afterward, the worker ants received food through the mouth of the Lasius orientalis queen ant, who then made the worker ants raise the ants that she gave birth to herself.

After reading this spelled out so clearly in Mr. Shimada's blog, Assist. Prof. Takasuka says, "I was so shocked that I was speechless." Mr. Shimada proposed turning it into a thesis paper, thinking, <i>It'll be a terrible problem if this scientific knowledge isn't recorded.</i>

Mr. Yuji Tanaka (41), who works at a company that does termite extermination in Tokyo, also knew about Mr. Shimada's discovery. He had observed it with another parasitic ant. He also found the same phenomenon occurring with the queen of the red ants.

He formed a team of three members and submitted a paper.

There are surely more "surprises" awaiting us, given that common sense is also often betrayed by the natural world

According to Assist. Prof. Takasuka, it isn't easy to bring to light the actual situation that's happening in the nest when the queen ant is killed. Mr. Shimada and Mr. Tanaka say that it's an invaluable discovery, "a job that can only be done by crazy ant enthusiasts."

This research study follows an approach that's called "Citizen Science," where ordinary people come together to participate. While Citizen Science appears to be proliferating, many researchers rely on ordinary people through a "top-down approach" when conducting their research study. Thus, this type of "bottom-up approach" is said to be rare.

Assist. Prof. Takasuka says, "The power that insect enthusiasts have goes together with paper-folding or origami. Many say that this could even be turned into a thesis paper." In doing so, the discovery goes beyond the community of enthusiasts, and scientific knowledge is passed onto the succeeding generations. Meanwhile, many reporters from media overseas continue to inquire about this research presentation.

"It's common for the natural world to betray our predictions. There are surely many more 'surprising' ways to kill a queen ant."
