>　あれ、ここには家があったはずだけれど――。連休中に久しぶりに帰省して、街の顔つきが以前と変わったことに驚いた方もいるだろう。ぽかりと口をあけた空き地や見知らぬアパートが立つ場所に、かつてどんな建物があったのか。見慣れたはずの道なのに思い出せない▼街とは、そうやって生まれ変わっていくものなのかもしれ…

Huh, there should have been a house here... During the long holiday, coming home after quite some time, I wondered about those people who would also be surprised to find the change in the street's facade from the one before. What was the building that was previously here, where this apartment that I do not recognize stands and this vacant land that do not come to mind exists? I should have been used to this road, yet I cannot remember.▼Perhaps the street is something that is born and goes on to change like so.
