### KEYPHRASE

> 携帯電話の新たな値引き規制を大手4社が総務省側に提案している。

The four (4) Big Telcos are proposing to the ADMINISTRATION a new mobile telephone discounting rule.

> 企業は本来なら自由な競争を求めるはずだが、規制の抜け穴を突く「1円スマホ」など過度な値引き合戦を自ら止められないと

The telcos essentially seek liberal competition, as they should, but are said to be unable to stop themselves from engaging in a battle of excessive discounting, such as the "1YEN smartphone", and so on.

> 2019年の法改正の際に開いていた穴をふさぐ措置だ

...[requested for] a mechanism to block the loophole opened during the revision of the rules in the Year 2019.

> ドコモが指す法改正とは、通信料金と端末代金の「完全分離」をうたい19年10月に施行されたものだ。回線契約とセットで端末を買う場合に通信料金を高額なキャッシュバックなどで値引きすることを禁止。さらに、セット販売での端末そのものの値引き上限を税込み2万2千円とした。

The revision in the rules indicated by DOCOMO was to implement in October of 2019 the "COMPLETE SEPARATION" of the communications service fee and the fee for the telephone device. It prohibits the large amount of CASHBACK used in the offering of discounts in the communications service fee in the case that the telephone device is also bought as a set with the connectivity service contract. Further, 22,000YEN (11,000PHP approx) is set to be the max that can be discounted for the telephone device included in the set.

>　ただし、回線契約を伴わない端末の販売は規制の対象外とした。「1円スマホ」がなくならない温床がここにある。

However, selling the telephone device without including the connectivity service contract was set to be outside the scope of the rule. It is here where the "1YEN SMARTPHONE" outcome lies.

### USBONG NOTES

1) Payment for the telephone device is returned via giving discount in the communications service fee.

> It prohibits the large amount of CASHBACK used in the offering of discounts in the communications service fee in the case that the telephone device is also bought as a set with the connectivity service contract. 

2) "1YEN SMARTPHONE" due to NO SELLING of SMARTPHONE only; payment put into the communications service fee. Amortization; Monthly Fee
