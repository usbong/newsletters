>　買い物上手の男が、知り合いに請われてともに瀬戸物屋へ出向いた。入り用なのは大きな壺（つぼ）なのに、男はなぜか小さいのを３円で買う。

A man skillful in shopping was asked by a friend to go to the SETO variety store together. Even though the container that the friend needed was a large pot, the man for some reason bought a small one at 3 YEN. 

> ２人で辺りをぐるっと巡るとまた店に戻って、やっぱり大きいのと取り換えてくれと番頭に頼む。落語「壺算」である▼

The two walked around the area and then returned again to the store, where they asked the store manager if they could have the item exchanged with the larger one. This is the RAKUGO Story, "Pot Count"▼

> 値段は倍の６円でよろしく、と男は強気だ。「さっき３円払ったろ…

The man vigorously requested to pay 6YEN for the item, twice the price of the small one. "Awhile ago, I paid 3YEN..."
