### KEYPHRASE

> 外国のミネラルウォーター

MINERAL WATER in FOREIGN COUNTRIES

> ヨーロッパの水だったかな。たぶん硬水（こうすい）


> 水が硬（かた）いとか、軟（やわ）らか

The WATER is HARD or SOFT?

> わずかに溶けているカルシウムやマグネシウムという成分の量で呼び分けているんだ。多いのが硬水、少ないのが軟水。この成分は、せっけんの汚れを落とす成分とくっついて、泡立ちをじゃまする性質がある。だから、日本のボディーソープを外国に持っていくと、いつものように泡立たないことがあるよ。

The difference is only based on the quantity of composition of CALCIUM, MAGNESIUM that melts. More is for HARD WATER, few is for SOFT WATER. It has characteristics that obstructs bubbles from forming, and sticks to its composition such that dirt from soap is removed. So, when the BODY SOAP from JAPAN is brought to foreign countries, there are cases when the bubbles do not form as they always have.

### USBONG NOTES

1) HARD WATER + SEWAGE DIRT = DIRTY HARD WATER?<br/>
--> notes: TOKYO CITY appears to have more HARD WATER than OSAKA CITY,<br/>
--> yet OSAKA CITY is said to have DIRTY WATER,<br/>
--> but this is not said of TOKYO CITY...

2) remembers: in SWITZERLAND, faucet water in public parks is said to be drinkable,<br/>
--> where: faucet water located in both CITY PARKS and MOUNTAIN ALP PARKS;<br/>
--> observed: WATER to have been COLD, <br/>
--> adds: has taste, at times,<br/>
--> as that from the nearby "ICE BLUE" Purified Drinking WATER Store, in MARIKINA City?<br/>
--> does: NOT taste as "MINERAL WATER";
