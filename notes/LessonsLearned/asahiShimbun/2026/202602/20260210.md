Panasonic Founder Matsushita Konosuke, the "God of Management," during his later years invested money in himself  by establishing the Matsushita Politics and Economics Review School. He believed that educating and nurturing talent were necessary in order to realize the ideal society. The school's selection criteria are told in a short essay 44 years ago. "Unlucky people are no good. After that, the next requirement is charisma." 

PM Takaichi, a fifth generation student of Matsushita-san's Politics and Economics Review School, aspired to become a politician upon meeting him. On the night before her entrance exam interview with Matsushita-san, their first encounter, her father advised her, "Put on a face that looks like you're lucky," according to the book that she launched when she became a new member of parliament. After the interview, it was said that the staff would "smile as wide as they could."

Still, "Luck and Charisma" aren't enough to explain her landslide win. A little over three months after she was appointed prime minister, the results of the elections for the House of Representatives, which would take 16 days from its dissolution until the votes were counted, were probably beyond what Ms. Takaichi had expected.
