He started to post in May of last year. He put out two channels with one being for SANSEITO, the party that he himself supported. Feeling that there's been a rise in the popularity of SANSEITO, he thought that he'd have a "chance" to make money during the Upper House elections in July.

Using photos and AI voice-overs, he'd post 3 to 10-minute videos whose content would have "Big business makes clear its support" or "News from a particular reporter refused" everyday. His videos that were played hundreds of thousands of times continued.

He recalls, "There's a rise in the attention given toward the elections, and there were no problems getting topics to talk about. It's  precisely the period of time to make money."
