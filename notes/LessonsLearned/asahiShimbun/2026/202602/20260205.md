As the elections for the House of Representatives draw near, the internet gets a deluge of videos related to politics. Videos whose content aren't clearly true or false, even those that use sensationalized wordings, get a lot of attention. What kind of person creates these videos? A man who's created a video channel and makes close to 900,000 yen a month speaks about his side of the story.

The elections are a "chance" to put out a support channel

He started to post in May of last year. He put out two channels with one being for SANSEITO, the party that he himself supported. Feeling that there's been a rise in the popularity of SANSEITO, he thought that he'd have a "chance" to make money during the Upper House elections in July. 

>　写真やAI（人工知能）の音声を使い、「有名企業が支持を表明した」「特定の記者の取材を拒否した」といった内容の3～10分の動画を、毎日投稿した。数十万回再生される動画が相次いだ。

Using photos and AI voice-overs, he'd post 3 to 10-minute videos whose content would have "Big business makes clear its support" or "News from a particular reporter rejected" everyday. His videos, which were played hundreds of thousands of times, continued.

He immediately earned income from the ads, and in the three months before, during, and after the elections, it went up to about 2.2 million yen. He recalls, "There's a rise in the attention given toward the elections, and there are no problems getting topics to talk about. It's  precisely the period of time to make money."

According to a study by senkyo.com, during the Upper House elections in July 2025, there were about 1.7 billion playbacks of politics-related video posts. 90% of which were videos streamed not by politicians nor any political party, but from "third-parties." About 40% of the content are "short summaries" of shortened speeches and news reports. Editor-in-Chief Suzuki says, "While there are also channels that are purely for support and which promulgate ideas of the party that they support, there are probably not a few whose goal is to make money."

Further, with the current system, which lets content creators make money out of ads according to video playbacks, there are cases when more emphasis is given to the number of playbacks instead of the correctness in the information. As long as there are plenty of viewers who have a specific way of thinking, there's a tendency that the videos, which that market segment likes, would be created a lot. Mr. Suzuki points out, "It's also necessary to raise the viewers' level of literacy."
