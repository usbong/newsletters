> 独自動車大手フォルクスワーゲン（VW）は30日、労働協約の見直しに向けた労使交渉を行い、従業員の賃金の10%引き下げを柱とする人件費の抑制策を提案した。業績が悪化しており、収益力を高めるのがねらい。労組側が反発していたドイツ国内の工場閉鎖案については言及はなかった。

Giant German Automaker Volkswagen (VW) met with its labor union on the 30th to negotiate and review its labor workforce agreement, proposing a pillar policy to reduce employee salaries by 10%. Its objective is to raise company profits amidst worsening performance. Meanwhile, there were no statements about closing down factories in Germany, a measure strongly opposed by the labor union.

>　労働協約はドイツ国内10工場のうち6工場の従業員ら約12万人が対象。経営側は、労組側が求めていた7%の賃上げを拒否し、賃下げに加え、複数のボーナス制度の廃止なども提案した。

The labor workforce agreement will affect a total of about 120,000 employees in six of the 10 factories in Germany. Executives had refused the 7% salary increase that the labor union sought, and in addition to lowering their salaries, they also proposed to have several bonus packages, among others, abolished.

>　経営側はドイツ国内のコスト負担が重く、競争力を弱めているとしており、「賃金水準を引き下げたとしても、業界内では、依然として非常に魅力的な水準だ」と訴えている。

Company executives explain that costs in Germany have become a heavy burden as its competitive power weakens. However, "Even if we lower the base salary, it's still an extremely attractive sum in this industry."

On the 28th, at the meeting composed of VW employees, executives announced that they're considering closing at least three local factories in Germany. This announcement was met with strong opposition due to as much as tens of thousands of employees would be laid off.

While no plans to lay-off employees were mentioned during the negotiations on the 30th, the labor union who opposed the massive employee layoffs to reduce costs is demanding the company's shareholders and executives to also share in the pains of the cost reductions. (@Berlin, TERANISHI, Kazuo)
