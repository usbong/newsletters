> 北海道・高村晴美さん（67）からの質問

A question from Ms TAKAMURA, Harumi (67) from Hokkaido

>　ののちゃん　この前、白いイチゴをもらったよ。とっても甘くてジューシーだった。

Young Nono: I was given a white strawberry the other day. It was very sweet and juicy.

>　藤原先生　最近、白い品種が増えてきたね。なんで白いんだと思う？

Teacher FUJIWARA: There's been an increase in the variety of products having the color white recently. Why do you think it's white?

>　のの　お日様に当たってないから？　ホワイトアスパラガスは太陽に当たらないように育てるって聞いたよ。

Young Nono: It doesn't get sunlight? I heard that white asparagus is grown by not letting the sun hit it with its sunlight.

>　先生　確かに、アスパラガスは、遮光シートなどを使って光合成ができないようにすれば緑にならないね。でも白いイチゴは太陽にあたっても白いの。

Teacher: Indeed, that asparagus is grown by using a light-blocking sheet, so that it cannot photosynthesize, thereby losing its green color. However, the white strawberry is produced white even when hit by sunlight.

>　のの　そうなんだ。じゃあ、もともと赤色になれないイチゴが見つかったのかな。

Young Nono: So people found a type of strawberry that won't turn red as it should?

>　先生　鋭いね。2008年に、国内で先駆けて食用に販売された白い品種が「初恋の香り」なんだって。もともと福島県の農家が品種改良で開発したんだよ。

Teacher: Great observation. In 2008, there was a variety of white strawberry that was the first to be sold locally for consumption. It was called "The scent of first love." It was originally developed by farmers in Fukushima Prefecture to improve product variety.

>　のの　いろんなイチゴを掛け合わせて、白いイチゴをつくりあげたってことか。

Nono: I see! They combined several types of strawberries to produce a white strawberry!

Teacher: Yes, this cross-breeding to produce white strawberry was said to have taken 20 years. While the product has a touch of pink color, if we examine its composition, it hardly has the red pigment anthocyanin. 

Nono: While the white strawberry is pretty, wouldn't it be mistaken to be sour at first, because people are not used to seeing it?

Teacher: It looks like there was also that concern at the start too. But actually, it's incredibly sweet and has a rich aroma. News at the time reported that 6,000 to 8,000 yen-packs that combined red and white strawberries were immediately sold out at the department store in Tokyo. It has become widely known for being used in various candies and sweets.

Nono: I wonder if it's still being cultivated up to now...

Teacher: Its seedlings are sold to a limited number of farmers only, and are not generally sold elsewhere. The product is then sold at department stores and fruit shops in downtown Tokyo.

Nono: You'd be lucky if you can find one!

Teacher: Other than this, there'll be a new product variety that'll be sold soon. It has a delicious aroma in Autumn even when cooked. And it's said to be sweet.

Nono: Probably, sweet potato? I'd want to eat one! 

Teacher: Correct. "Kimimaroko" is a white sweet potato that's been improved and processed to have the same taste as its red counterpart.

Nono: I wonder if there's a product that's been cross-bred to have the red color instead?

Teacher: There is! A red sweet corn called "Yamato Rouge." It's been in the market since 2022. Comparing it with another sweet corn that has the same weight, it's said to have plenty of the anthocyanin, even greater than the strawberry's.

Nono: It looks like there'll again be a new agricultural product with a new color coming out soon. Very exciting!
