> 抗うつ剤の「パロキセチン」にくも膜下出血の原因となる脳動脈瘤（どうみゃくりゅう）の破裂を予防する効果があるかもしれない――。大規模データベースの解析により、既存の薬に別の作用がある可能性を国立病院機構や国立循環器病研究センター（国循）のグループが見つけ米専門誌に発表した。

There might be a link between the anti-depressant "Paroxetine" and preventing ruptured cerebral aneurysm caused by Subarachnoid hemorrhaging... The National Hospital Organization and the National Cerebral and Cardiovascular Disease Research Center, among others, have presented in a U.S. specialist magazine their findings on the possible use of the existing drug in such a manner based on their analysis of a large-scale database.

>　くも膜下出血はおよそ3分の1が死亡、3分の1にまひや意識障害が残る。主な原因は、脳の動脈にできたこぶの破裂で、破裂のリスクはこぶが大きいほど高くなる。日本は海外に比べてくも膜下出血の発症率が高いことが課題になっている。

About one in three people die due to Subarachnoid hemorrhaging, while one in three people experience problems such as numbness and consciousness-related disorders. The main cause is the rupture of a bulging artery in the brain. Meanwhile, the risk of the rupture increases with larger bulging arteries. Compared overseas, Japan has a high rate of onset of Subarachnoid hemorrhaging.

>　国立病院機構京都医療センターの福田俊一診療部長（脳神経外科）らは、「P2X4」というたんぱく質の働きを止めると、脳動脈瘤の発生や増大を抑えられることを動物実験で確認。P2X4は、血流の感知にかかわり、血流による血管の負荷が増すと脳動脈瘤ができることも示した。

Medical Chief FUKUDA, Shunichi of the National Hospital Organization and the Kyoto Medical Treatment Center (Neurosurgery) et al. have confirmed through animal tests that when the functioning of the protein "P2X4" is stopped, the onset and enlargement of the cerebral aneurysm can be controlled.

>　福田さんらは、抗うつ剤として長く使われている「パロキセチン」に注目。パロキセチンには抗うつの作用とは別に、P2X4を抑える働きがある。脳動脈瘤がある人で、この薬を飲んでいる人とそうでない人を比較すれば、脳動脈瘤に対する効果もわかると考えた。

Dr. FUKUDA et al. focused on the drug "Paroxetine" which has long been used as an anti-depressant. Besides its anti-depressive effects, it can also control the functioning of P2X4. They discovered this when they investigated patients who have cerebral aneurysm, and compared those who drank the medicine and those who didn't.

They then decided to analyze the large-scale patient database (research work headed by Hospital Chief IIHARA, Koji) that contained patient data of admitted stroke patients nationwide.

When a patient is found to have cerebral aneurysm, two medical treatments exist: one where the root of the bulging artery is clamped using a clip, and another which is called "Coil Embolization" where a gold coil is placed inside the bulge; however, there are patients who choose neither. 1-3% of those who underwent the surgery with the clip relapse, while it's 10-30% for those who underwent the coil embolization.

They compared the 37 people who have cerebral aneurysm and are taking the Paroxetine with the 396 patients who aren't taking the medicine. They also compared the 38 people who underwent the coil embolization with the 308 people who didn't undergo the surgery. Among those who had taken the medicine, the ratio of those whose cerebral aneurysm grew larger is one in seven of those patients who didn't take the medicine. In the same way, they found that the rate of relapse one year after undergoing the coil surgery decreased to less than one in four.

"The drug can be used as a preventive measure for patients who find surgery difficult. While we've investigated the database, we want to confirm the validity of the findings in clinical research," says Mr. FUKUDA.

The thesis is published in the U.S. specialty magazine (https://doi.org/10.3171/2024.6.JNS24714; last accessed: 20241030). (HASEGAWA, Shigeko)
