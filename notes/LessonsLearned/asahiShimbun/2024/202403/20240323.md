On the 22nd, Mitsubishi Motors was reported to have been evaluating the revival of its "PAJERO" SUV (Sports Utility Vehicle) in 2027. While production was terminated in 2021, it's going to be on sale again due to strong popular demand.

Last year, the company announced that it's positioning "Mitsubishi Motors" with policies on 4-wheel drive technology for rugged terrain, and is currently strengthening its product lineup. The model that it's reviving anew is being developed based on the power-focused pick-up truck "TRITON". It's planned to be imported from DAI Factory. (WAKAI, Takumi)

The PAJERO that was sold in 1982 was one of the 4-wheel drive vehicles launched by the company. It focused on driving performance for rugged terrain, and was famous for being the overall champion in the Paris Dakar Rally in Africa, among others. 

However, because of the vehicle's weight, it had bad fuel consumption, and therefore couldn't increase its customer base, such that production for the local market was stopped in 2019. In 2021, production for the overseas market was also terminated, and the factory in Gifu Prefecture was closed down. (WAKAI, Takumi)

### USBONG NOTE

1) Power-focused truck-type SUVs, including ISUZU Crosswinds, are common targets by carnappers and fake sellers in the Philippines. Even Automatic Transmission (AT) can much more easily be carnapped by stealing the car key inside the house. Quick money. 500K PHP and up. Adding CCTV Cameras makes it even easier for criminals who have access to Internet traffic and view IP addresses coming from the target household.

Solution? Hint: Car key stolen by people familiar with household and  can come and go out of the house. The people who commit the crime are always in-need of money due to increasing family members without taxable work. 

Therefore, the solution is to simply reduce family members without taxable work. 

In the end, no need to depend on people who are in-need of money, because they would rather lie for whatever excuse, than tell the truth.
