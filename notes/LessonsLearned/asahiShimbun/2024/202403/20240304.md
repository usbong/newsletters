>　岩手県陸前高田市の佐藤ヒデさんは、93歳。

Ms SATO, Hide from Rikuzen Takada City in Iwate Prefecture is 93 years old.

>　健康診断を受けたら、血管年齢は20歳、基礎代謝などで判断する体内年齢は36歳という結果が出た。

Results from her health examination showed that the age of her blood vessels is 20 years old. Further, based on basic things like her metabolism, her body age is 36 years old.

>　その若さの理由を知りたくなった。

I wanted to know the reason for her youthfulness.

>　測定したのは、昨年の敬老の日近くの9月15日。場所は、佐藤さんが週1回通所している同市のデイケアサービス施設「ワーカーズコープ陸前高田事業所百笑」だった。

The examination was conducted the previous year, in September 15 near Respect for the Aged Day. The venue was set at "Workers Co-op 100 Smiles Rikuzen Takada Center", a daycare located in the same city. Ms SATO goes there once a week.

>　ボランティアで施設を訪れていた看護師の赤田慎太郎さん（48）が簡易健康診断をした。身長、体重、体脂肪率のほか、人さし指を機器に差し込んで血圧や脈拍も測る。表示された数字に、赤田さんは計器がおかしいのかと思ったが、他の通所者や職員の数値は正常だった。

The simple health examination was performed by Nurse SEKIDA, Shintaro (48), a volunteer at the health center at the time. Aside from measuring physical characteristics like height, weight, and rate of body fat, he also took note of the patient's blood pressure and pulse by putting her finger into an electronic device. Mr SEKIDA had thought that the measuring device was malfunctioning because of the numbers it displayed, but the values from the other visitors and staff personnel were normal.

The author of this news article visited Ms SATO's house during the end of November of the previous year.

> 佐藤さんは、現在の陸前高田市出身。80歳の時に東日本大震災で自宅が流され、現在は市内の災害公営住宅で一人暮らしをしている。得意料理の甘酒を出す動作は、とても機敏だ。

Ms SATO was born in Rikuzen Takada City. When she was 80 years old, her home was flooded and was washed away due to the Great East Japan Earthquake, which is why she is now living by herself at a disaster housing facility within the city. She is very agile in making sweet sake, her specialty.

### USBONG NOTE

1) Tokyo Metropolitan City Professor FURUKAWA, Ryuzo (Environmental Studies) does consultation work with over 600 senior citizens around the age of 90 locally and abroad, including Ms SATO. He says, "What energetic people have in common is positivity and this feeling of gratefulness. They also do things without seeking something in return. Because of this, they don't accumulate a lot of stress, which could be the reason why Ms SATO is able to maintain her youthfulness." 

2) Ms SATO is the 6th of 7 siblings. Her father died young from a vehicular accident, and her older sister sold ice creams to make ends meet for the family. Eventually, they were able to transform the business into a food and beverages store, and was able to further develop it into a supermarket. Ms SATO helps out with the work, grateful that her sister can overcome difficulties unperturbed. She says, "I learned from her the power of action."

Ms SATO also has the power to adapt to her new environment. "She'd take the initiative to clean the front of their house," and "greet people with a smile." So when she lost her husband, and then their house after the earthquake, even if conditions were becoming worse, and she had to move to a shelter, and then to temporary housing before transferring to the disaster housing facility, she says, "There was no hardship whatsoever."

3) Near the window of her house, there had been a sewing machine. On the wall, western clothes that had been mended were hanging in an orderly fashion. At 88 years old, she had become interested in making western clothing, so she bought a sewing machine and started sewing. She gave the finished clothes as gifts to friends who liked them. This forward looking attitude may be the reason why she has continued to be energetic.

Immediately after the earthquake, and while still hardly adept at sewing, she made a rag doll out of Crêpe fabric, and gave it as a gift to a woman who had lost her daughter.

4) Listening to Ms SATO talk, I thought that what made an impact on her was the multitude of times she had to "change residences." Because her husband worked in the financial sector, they had to move about 40 times all over the Tohoku region, while raising their 3 children. And whenever they did those, "She had to sort their things, put them in a box and clean up in a week's time." I think that it's perhaps because of this that she was able to improve her skill set in things like decisiveness and memory.
