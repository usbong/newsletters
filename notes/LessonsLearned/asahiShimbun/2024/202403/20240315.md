>　今年1月の台湾総統選の投票率は7割を超え、候補者の集会に大勢の若者が参加して声援を送る姿が日本でも注目されました。「民主主義のお手本」とも評され、日本との議員交流も盛んな台湾ですが、台湾出身で日本に移住した芥川賞作家の李琴峰（りことみ）さん（34）は、台湾社会にも「光と陰がある」といいます。李さんから見た台湾の姿について聞きました。

During the presidential elections in Taiwan in January of this year, the number of voters exceeded 70%, and there were plenty of young people supporting candidates at the campaign events, receiving notable attention even in Japan. Seen as "the role model of democracy", Taiwan has had an abundance of diplomatic exchanges with Japan. Born in Taiwan and then moved later to Japan, Akutagawa Prize Winner Ms LI, Kotomi (34) says that Taiwanese society has "light and dark sides" too. We asked Ms LI regarding her views on Taiwan.

>　――なぜ台湾は政治への熱が高いのですか。

Q: Why is there a high degree of excitement over Taiwanese politics?

>　台湾は、戦後の独裁体制下から民衆が民主化を勝ち取った歴史があります。それを学校で教わり、自由な選挙の大切さを学びます。

In Taiwan, history tells us that democracy was won by a people who were under authoritarian rule after the war. This is what is taught in schools, where students learn the value of freedom of choice.

>　さらに台湾は、中国との関係性をめぐる問題を抱えています。中国からの圧力が強まる中、中国にのみ込まれてしまうのではないかといった警戒心が、政治への関心を高めています。

Further, Taiwan is currently tackling the issue concerning its relationship with China. With pressure from China intensifying, there has also been an increase in political concern over worries that it would be taken over by China.

>　そして、まさにその問題に直面して起きたのが2014年の「ひまわり学生運動」でした。中国とのサービス貿易協定を強行採決しようとした国民党政権に若者らが反発して立法院（国会）を占拠し、その後審議のやり直しが決まりました。この体験が、政治参加の大切さを若者に教えたのです。

It is precisely this problem that the "Sunflower Student Movement" confronted in 2014. Young people occupied the National Legislature (Legislative Yuan) to protest against the Kuomintang Government which was attempting to heavy handedly move votes in favor of service trade agreements with China. After the incident, government decided to review its decision. This experience taught young people the value of participatory governance.

>　――一方で日本では政治への熱が高くありません。特に若者の政治離れが顕著です。

Q: On the other hand, passion for politics in Japan is not as intense. It's remarkable that young people, in particular, move away from government.

>　根本には、政治に対する無力感が広がっています。年金制度などへの信用がなく、「どうせ変わらない」という思いから、若者は政治に頼らず、自分自身で何とかするという方向に向かっているように見えます。

At its root is the feeling of powerlessness when it comes to government. Having no belief in things like the pension system, and saying that "things won't change anyway," young people appear to be more inclined towards the idea that they by themselves can somehow survive without depending on the government.

>　また台湾では大学卒業後にNPO活動など社会運動に参加してから就職する人もいますが、日本の新卒重視の就活システムの下ではそうした活動に参加するのは簡単ではありません。

Also in Taiwan, university graduates can join community-oriented activities like at Non-profits, and then apply for a regular job, but doing these within the Japanese job hunting system is not simple.

>　台湾でも、そうそう政治は変わりません。それでもひまわり学生運動の成功体験もあり、「1人ではダメでも、大勢集まれば動かせる」という無邪気な信念があるように感じます。

Even in Taiwan, government does not change much. Nevertheless, there are success stories like the Sunflower Student Movement, and I feel that there is still naivete in the belief that "even if one person alone can't change things, when a large group of people gather, they can get things moving."

>　――台湾は民主主義のお手本のように言われることもあります。

Q: Taiwan has been called the role model of democracy.

>　政権交代をしているので民主主義の最低限の条件は達成していますが、問題もあります。歴史的に見て台湾の民主主義の実現は、台湾の主体性を重んじ、台湾の未来は台湾自身が決めるという「ナショナリズム」の高揚によって進んだ側面があります。ひまわり学生運動もそうです。

Because administrations come and go, problems still exist, even though the minimum requirements of democracy can be met. Looking at the history of Taiwan with respect to Taiwanese independence, there is a celebration of "nationalism", where the people of Taiwan themselves chose their own future. The Sunflower Student Movement is a testament to this too.

>　台湾では、自由や人権といった普遍的な価値観を掲げるリベラリズムの動きと、ナショナリズムの動きは密接に関わり合ってきましたが、衝突することもあります。そして両者が衝突した場合、優先されるのはいつもナショナリズムではないかという問題があります。

In Taiwan, nationalism, which lauds generally accepted values like freedom and human rights, is also tied with conflict. And whenever the two collide, the question that is always asked is whether nationalism should be prioritized.

> 2013年に来日した際、時代の空気の変化を感じたという李さん。日本が台湾に注目をするようになったのはそのころからだと言います。

When Ms LI came to Japan in 2013, she felt the change in the atmosphere during those times. Japan has given Taiwan more attention starting around that time, she says.

>　――どんなことがあったのでしょうか。

Q: What could have happened?

## MORE

There's truth in my novel "Polaris" where I depicted women with diverse sexual identities.

During the Sunflower Student Movement, a group of students had brandished the "Rainbow Club" as a symbol of sexual diversity after they occupied the legislative hall. However, it has since been removed after it "stopped being the image of the movement".

While it was a movement that was initiated to protest against the unbridled actions of the Ruling Party at the time, at its core, it was about the voice of the sexual minority, who chanted about human rights and equality, that was being suppressed. This is an actual example of putting nationalism at the front, so that liberalism can be forced into concession. 


Q: Still, the administration led by the Democratic Party was able to legalize same sex marriage in 2019, and this time, the party won during the elections.

Legalizing same sex marriage was without a doubt correct, and the Democratic Party's administration  saw it as an important accomplishment. However, when public opinion changed, the rights of the sexual minority were sacrificed, and there is a feeling of danger that rights such as those may simply be dropped at a whim. The Rainbow Flag has since been removed, and amidst the priority given to policies against China, there is the likelihood that policies on gender equality will be set aside for later. 

Many Taiwanese people have supported Japan's conservative politicians as well as those in the US who have taken a strong stand against China. These politicians are vocal against the discrimination experienced by people with disabilities, the sexual minority, and women in their own countries, and they give cases where human rights are not respected. It pains me that nationalism is given priority. 

Q: By using the fear of China as a front, there has been a rising level of attention given to Taiwan in Japan.

When I came to Japan in 2013, I saw that the shelves of the bookstores had a wall of books on anti-China and anti-Korea. Compared to when I first came to Japan, I felt that the atmosphere had changed. It was around that same time when Japan had given Taiwan more attention.

Japan-Taiwan relations get distorted. Japan has a history of having made Taiwan a colony. After the war, Japan became the "Man of Asia", and not a few people looked down on Taiwan. On the other hand, in Taiwan, it was said that "all Japanese products are excellent." It's the so-called Taiwan's unrequited love toward Japan.

During the Great East Japan Earthquake in 2011, Taiwan donated large sums of financial aid to Japan, and amidst China's rise, Taiwan as a partner received considerable attention from Japan. 

Japanese conservatives say "they like Taiwan." However, when we listen to their speeches, they say ready-made expressions like "It's because there was a time when Japan made Taiwan a colony that Taiwan has been able to modernize," so "Taiwanese people like Japan". To justify the history of the occupation, they use Taiwan as a matter of convenience. I think they don't really like Taiwan.

Seeing only the bright side

Q: What do you want Japanese people to understand about Taiwan?

I think that I can say this for all, not only Taiwan, but things are never one-sided. At the start of the Corona Virus, Taiwan gave an "Identification Number (ID)" for everyone, and supplied masks quickly and equally. This was praised in Japan. But the ID system was originally used to manage the population during the dictatorship. If there's a bright side, there's also a dark side.

Going to Taiwan for travel, people remark that "The people are nice, and the food is delicious." So, many Japanese people say "they like Taiwan." This in itself is good, but a person who only "sees the bright side" can only "do tours ('see the light')." I think that I want people to know about a diverse Taiwan, including its dark aspects.
