### USBONG NOTE

1) PlayStation 3 arrived at the household in about the year 2012. Online purchasing via PlayStation Network (PSN) became available. However, location had to be set to Singapore (SG). Over a decade later, no Philippine (PH) setting was yet available on PSN. Steam now provides an alternative.
