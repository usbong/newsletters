> 進化するAI（人工知能）に職が奪われてしまう不安が高まっています。そんななか、すべての人に最低限の生活費を給付するベーシックインカム（BI）の議論が再び注目されています。貧困の現場からはどう見えるのか。宇都宮市で子ども食堂を運営する荻野友香里さんに聞きました。

There is increasing worry that advancements in Artificial Intelligence (AI) will steal people's jobs. Amidst this context, discussions on Basic Income (BI) to provide for the minimum living expenses of the population are again receiving their much needed attention. How is this viewed in poverty-stricken areas? We asked Ms OGINO, Yukari who runs a children's cafeteria in Uchinomiya City.  

>　2016年に宇都宮市では初めてとなる子ども食堂を開きました。今は25人超が通ってきます。栃木県内の子ども食堂は100ケ所ほどあり、必要とされています。

Ms OGINO opened the first children's cafeteria in Uchinomiya City in 2016. There are now over 25 people who come to work there. Children's cafeterias have become a necessity in Tochigi prefecture where as much as 100 of them can be found within the locality.

>　貧困など苦しい状況に直面している子どもたちもいます。最貧国などとは違い、日本という豊かな社会で育っているのに、他の家にあるものが自分の家庭にはない人もいるのです。

There are still children who are trapped in poverty. Unlike very poor countries, Japan is said to be an affluent society, but to raise children in this country, there will be people whose households would have things that others won't. 

>　では、お金さえ渡せば解決するのか。確かに、金銭的支援があれば立ち直れる家庭も少なくありません。生活保護制度はあっても、必要な家庭に必ずしも届いてはいない。必死に働いても生活費が足りず、結果的に子が放置されている状況もある。「ベーシックインカム（BI）さえあれば」と思う時もあります。

If so, wouldn't the solution be as simple as handing out money? For sure, there are not a few households that would be able to get themselves out of poverty with the help of monetary aid. But while there are measures to protect people's lives, help never really reaches those households that need them the most. Even if poor people worked hard, their incomes cannot sufficiently cover their living expenses, resulting to cases where children are left abandoned. During these times, people think that "if they only had Basic Income (BI)," they could somehow survive.

>　一方、お金を渡すだけでは解決しないとも感じます。

On the other hand, I feel that simply handing out money won't solve the problem.

While support structures are, of course, important, I think that what is first needed is to show that the adults nearby enjoy working. Work becomes meaningful when people do it not solely for their own sakes. Thus, they earn income and are able to lead a normal life. If children can see this, they should be able to continue on living, hopeful of what the future may hold.

While people say that AI will steal their jobs, this isn't a tragedy. For example, in fields like mountain forestry management, workers are scarce. Jobs that seek the warmth of human contact from people who care won't disappear. In the age of AI, there'll likely be new jobs that will be created too.

The problem lies in the big disparity in people's wages. Even if people worked hard, many still get trapped in life due to the low wages. Meaningful work is a prerequisite to living a fulfilling life. Therefore, it is first necessary that society show that people who work can live a decent life.

There is also disparity in opportunities for children to learn. Even if the mountain is near, there are children who have never gone to the mountain. So, they don't know the path to climb the mountain, and they don't know that there is work there.

While I agree with the idea that BI protects the basic human life of people, the way to solve this type of problem should be what I've just discussed. (Reporter: OKADA, Gen)
