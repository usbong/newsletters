> 進化するAI（人工知能）に職が奪われてしまう不安が高まっています。そんななか、すべての人に最低限の生活費を給付するベーシックインカム（BI）の議論が再び注目されています。貧困の現場からはどう見えるのか。宇都宮市で子ども食堂を運営する荻野友香里さんに聞きました。

There is growing worry that advancements in Artificial Intelligence (AI) will steal people's jobs. Amidst this backdrop, discussions on Basic Income (BI) to provide for the minimum living expenses of all people are again receiving attention. How is this viewed at the poverty level? We ask Ms OGINO, Yuakri who runs a children's cafeteria in Uchinomiya City.  

>　2016年に宇都宮市では初めてとなる子ども食堂を開きました。今は25人超が通ってきます。栃木県内の子ども食堂は100ケ所ほどあり、必要とされています。

Ms OGINO opened the first children's cafeteria in Uchinomiya City in 2016. There are now over 25 people who come to work there. Being a necessity, there are as much as 100 children's cafeterias within the Tochigi Prefecture. 

>　貧困など苦しい状況に直面している子どもたちもいます。最貧国などとは違い、日本という豊かな社会で育っているのに、他の家にあるものが自分の家庭にはない人もいるのです。

Children struggle with poverty. Unlike very poor countries, Japan is said to be a society of abundance, but to raise children in this country, there will be people whose households would have things that are not found in others'. 

>　では、お金さえ渡せば解決するのか。確かに、金銭的支援があれば立ち直れる家庭も少なくありません。生活保護制度はあっても、必要な家庭に必ずしも届いてはいない。必死に働いても生活費が足りず、結果的に子が放置されている状況もある。「ベーシックインカム（BI）さえあれば」と思う時もあります。

If so, wouldn't simply handing out money solve the problem? For sure, there are not a few household that would be able to recover with the help of monetary aid. Even if there are measures to protect life, they never reach households that need them the most. Even if poor people worked hard, their incomes cannot sufficiently cover their living expenses, resulting to cases where children are abandoned. These are times when people think, "If only we have Basic Income (BI)." 

　一方、お金を渡すだけでは解決しないとも感じます。

On the one hand, I feel that simply handing out money won't solve the problem.

While support structures are, of course, important, I think that what is first needed is to show that adults nearby enjoy working. Work because it is meaningful for the sake of someone. Income is received, to be able to lead a normal lifestyle. If children can see this sort of thing, they should be able to live looking forward.

While people say that AI will steal their jobs, this isn't a tragedy. For example, in fields like mountain forestry management, workers are scarce. Jobs that seek human warmth like care won't disappear. In the age of AI, there'll likely be new jobs that 
will be created too.

The problem is with the big disparity in wages. Even if people work hard, there are many people who get trapped in life due to low wage. Meaning is a prerequisite to living a full life. A society that shows that if people work, they can live a decent life is first necessary.

There is also disparity shown in opportunities for children to learn. Even if the mountain is near, there are children who have never gone there. So, they don't know the mountain path, and they don't know that there is work there.

While I agree with the idea of BI to protect the fundamental life of all people, the way to solve this sort of problem should be what I've said. (Reporter: OKADA, Gen)
