> 日米比3カ国は、岸田文雄首相とバイデン米大統領の4月10日のワシントンでの首脳会談に合わせ、フィリピンのマルコス大統領を交えた3カ国首脳会談を行う方向で最終調整していることが分かった。事前準備のため、上川陽子外相が20日にフィリピンを訪問し、日米比外相会談を行う予定だ。複数の日本政府関係者が明らかにした。

The three nations led by Japanese Prime Minister KISHIDA, Fumio, U.S. President BIDEN and Philippine President MARCOS met in Washington in April 10 to discuss the finalization of their plans to form a security alliance. As part of the preparations, foreign service diplomat KAMIKAWA, Yoko is visiting the Philippines on the 20th to hold a discussion among JP-US-PH diplomats. Several members of the Japanese government have shed light on this plan.

>　海洋進出を強める中国を牽制（けんせい）するため、日本はフィリピンについて「準同盟国」級への格上げを図っており、首脳会談では米国を軸にした3カ国の枠組みで連携強化を確認する。20日の日米比外相会談では、南シナ海でフィリピン船と中国船が衝突する事案が続く中、安全保障面での連携をさらに強める。

To keep China from asserting its ocean exploration aspirations, Japan is raising the level of its "preparatory alliance" with the Philippines, something that Japan has affirmed at the meeting to strengthen their mutual alliance which hinges on America. Regarding the meeting among JP-US-PH diplomats on the 20th, the objective is to further strengthen the security cooperation among the three nations, in light of the continuous collision incidents between Philippine and Chinese ships in the South China Sea.

### USBONG NOTE

1) Japan and the US are strengthening their security cooperation agreements with the Philippines after the MARCOS Administration has made clear at the start of its term the importance of US-Philippine relations. In a meeting in November of the previous year, Prime Minister KISHIDA has officially agreed to the "Reciprocal Access Agreement (RAA)" which aims to shorten the immigration procedures necessary during joint training exercises between the Japanese self-defense force and the Philippine military. He also agreed to provide a coastal surveillance radar to the Philippine military.

Before Ms KAMIKAWA's visit to the Philippines, she, as the president of the United Nations Security Council, will be holding on the 18th a public meeting among the cabinet members on the theme, "Nuclear Disarmament and Non-proliferation" in New York. 

### USBONG NOTE

1) China government is for regulations and security; Can Philippine government enforce security regulations? Plan is if with Japan, US, among others, yes. However, Philippine dependency problem continues due to population in-need of money; How many members in family without (taxed) income from work?
