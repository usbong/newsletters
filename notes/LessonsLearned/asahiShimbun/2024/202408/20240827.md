>　通信アプリ「テレグラム」の最高経営責任者（CEO）がフランスで逮捕された問題で、仏検察当局は26日、組織的な違法取引を可能にするプラットフォームの運営など12件の容疑について捜査していると明らかにした。逮捕をめぐっては表現の自由の観点から批判が強まっており、マクロン仏大統領は同日、「政治的決定によるものではない」との声明を発表した。

The Chief Executive Officer (CEO) of the communications app "Telegram" has been arrested in France. French authorities have announced that they are investigating the platform's operations due to 12 accusations concerned with enabling criminal organizations to make illegal transactions through it. There's growing criticism coming from the perspective of freedom of expression in the arrest of the CEO. In response to this, French President MACRON has issued a statement on the same day saying, "The action was not decided for political reasons."

>　仏メディアによると、テレグラムのCEOで創業者でもあるロシア出身のパベル・ドゥロフ氏は24日夜、アゼルバイジャンからパリ郊外のルブルジェ空港にプライベートジェットで到着したところを仏警察に逮捕された。仏国籍を保持しており、現在はアラブ首長国連邦（UAE）に拠点を置いているという。

According to French media, the Telegram CEO and Russian-born entrepreneur Mr. Pavel DUROV was arrested by the French police on the evening of the 24th when his private jet landed at Le Bourget Airport, a suburb of Paris, coming from Azerbaijan. Possessing French citizenship, he is reported to have setup his headquarters in the United Arab Emirates (UAE).

>　パリの検察当局は26日の声明で、ドゥロフ氏の逮捕は7月8日に開始したサイバー犯罪に関連する捜査の一環だと説明。組織的な違法取引を可能にするプラットフォームの運営や児童ポルノ画像の流布などの共謀のほか、関係当局の規制への協力の拒否など12件の容疑を挙げている。

Paris Authorities explained on the 26th that the arrest of Mr. DUROV is part of investigations concerned with cyber-criminal activities which began in July 8. The platform is facing a total of 12 accusations including its refusal to abide with official regulations, in addition to enabling criminal organizations to make illegal transactions as well as anonymously share and distribute child pornography.

While authorities have not yet been clear on which accusations apply to Mr. DUROV, according to French media, it's possible that he's being questioned for the crime of negligence in moderating content on the platform which includes the monitoring and deletion of inappropriate posts by organized criminals who use the platform to share information anonymously.

There is growing criticism against France on the Internet coming from the perspective of freedom of expression after the arrest of Mr. DUROV. Telegram emphasized on the 25th, "It's unreasonable to demand that the platform and its owners take responsibility for the illegal use of the platform by its users." American Entrepreneur Mr. Elon MUSK posted on the same day on X (formerly, Twitter), "Release Pabel!", etc. 

Russia's anti-administration leader, Mr. Leonid BOLCOF, who is close with Alexei NAVALNY who passed away while under-surveillance inside the prison in the Arctic, points out, "I don't completely understand the connection between third-party criminal activities on the platform and the imprisonment of its founder."

"In response to this, Mr. MACRON argued on the evening of the 26th, "France values more than anything the entrepreneurial spirit and freedom of expression." Regarding the arrest of Mr. DUROV, he posted, "This is never a political decision, but something decided by the judge."

Telegram is widely used in Russia to send out propaganda from the Putin Administration, presentations by the Russian Army, etc. Hence, there is growing sentiment that the arrest of Mr. DUROV is partially politically motivated.

On the other hand, even independent media and Russia's anti-administration groups make use of Telegram to send out important information. It's also actively used by the Ukrainian government and media.

Based on initial investigations, it's considered that the aim of Mr. MACRON's argument against the criticisms concerned with freedom of expression is to remove political speculations. (@Paris, SONG, Guangyu)
