>　ある人にとっては要らないモノが、別の人にはのどから手が出るほど欲しい「お宝」に――。フリーマーケットの売り買いをスマートフォンで気軽にできるようにしたメルカリ。日々さまざまなものが流通していますが、売れ筋のデータをみると、約10年前と今では大きく変わっています。消費者が求めるものは何か。日本事業トップの山本真人・執行役に聞きました。

For some people, something that others don't need is "pearl" that they'd want to get their hands on... Enter Mercari where people can easily buy and sell flee market goods using their smartphones. While a whole variety of goods move through the service everyday, sales data show that there has been a large change between the items sold about 10 years ago and those currently sold on the service. What are consumers searching? We ask top Japanese Business Executive Mr. YAMAMOTO, Masato. 

>　――公表データでみると、メルカリでの累計出品数は30億品、月間の利用者は2300万人います。2010年代半ばにサービスが始まったとき、記者は「ヤフーオークションと何が違うのか？」と思いましたが、ここまで広まった理由をどうみていますか。

When we look at publicly available data, there are 3 billion products sold at Mercari, whose users count to 23 million per month. When the service started in the mid-2010s, reporters wondered "what its difference with Yahoo Auctions is." What do you think has been the reason for its wide popularity up to this point?

>　「『要らないから捨てるしかないモノが、実は資産になる』ということが定着したからだと思っています。特に、1990年代半ばから2010年代序盤に生まれたZ世代は、『大きな消費はしない』と言われていますが、我々のデータでは、『推し活』など自分の興味の対象にはすごくお金を使う。そのために、いま不要なモノを売る。『推し』の対象が変われば売る。モノを抱え込むのではなく循環させることが、当たり前になっています」

We believe that "things that are not needed and can simply be thrown away actually turn into assets." In particular, during the mid-90s up until the start of the 2010s when the Gen-Z was born, we were told that "they don't consume a lot." However, from our data, we found that they actually spend a large amount of their money for their "favorite pastimes" and personal interests. Because of this, they now sell things that they don't anymore need. If their current "favorite" changes, they'd sell. It has become natural for them to let things go without holding on to them.

> 「もちろん、昨今の物価上昇もあります。物価が上がったので給料も上がる、なら良いのですが、なかなかそうでもない。ではどうするか。欲しいモノを買う原資を生み出すために不要なモノを売る。新品よりも安く買える。それが支持されていると思います」

"Of course, these days the price of commodities has also been rising. Since the prices of commodities have risen, salaries have also increased. While this may seem good, it's hardly so in actuality. What then do we do? To create a resource fund for selling things that people want, things that are not needed have to be sold. They can be bought more cheaply than new products. I think that there is support for this endeavor."

>　「ジャンル別でみると、14年で最多だったのは、女性向けの服やバッグ・靴といった『レディース』（37%）でした。これが23年は、おもちゃやゲーム・本などの『エンタメ・ホビー』（28%）になっています。ゲームボーイのソフトや昔の少年ジャンプ誌など、もはや新品が買えないモノは人気ですね。漫画でも、色あせした昔の本をわざわざ探している人も多い。レトロ感が受けています」

"Looking at the different genres, what had sold the most for the past 14 years is the so-called "Ladies" items (37%), which include female clothes, bags and shoes. In 2023, this became "Hobbies and Entertainment" (28%), which includes toys, games, and books, among others. What have become popular are Gameboy software, old Shonen Jump magazines, and maybe news things that cannot anymore be bought. Even among Manga comic books, there have also been plenty of people who'd go out of their way to search for old and almost faded books. These evoke a retro feel to them."

>　――売れ筋のブランド品にも変化があるそうですね。

There also seems to be a change in the sales of branded items?

"The top items sold in 2013 based on brand have been 1) Chanel, 2) Apple and 3) Louis Vuitton." In 2022, "1) Uniqlo, 2) Nike and 3) Adidas."

What could be learned from this?

It's not that "there is decreasing movement in the quantity of high-class branded goods per genre. Instead, now even non-high value commodities can be sold. In actuality, there are people who want to buy those. Given such a situation, there is overwhelmingly more Uniqlo T-shirts sold than bags. This has become the new order of priority. We think that each item that can be sold for a low price will be sold."

"We think that our biggest achievement is in consciously improving the items found in our service and its interface so that buying and selling things can become part of daily life, like breathing."

In recent years, the business has been expanding "Mercari Hallo", which Spotworks has been working on in short bursts during idle time, "Merpay", the mobile payment service and "Mercoin", its digital crypto-currency. What is the aim of these? 

"The Hallo service began in March of this year, and has 5 million registered users. It's a huge moonshot. We sense that there are many users who, instead of saying 'we want money', would work part-time for about three times at Hallo and buy things they want and which they saw at Mercari using their compensation." There are also many users of Merpay and Mercoin. They buy things that they want at Mercari after obtaining money from selling things there, and if there's none that they want, they may invest it in the service."

"The young generation is especially sensitive to the destruction of the global environment as a result of high volumes of production and consumption. Commercial products and services that may be cheap but add to this problem are becoming less preferable to consumers."

"'Reuse' is tied to 'Economical'. From our study, there are 36 million people who say that 'they want to try selling a product that's not yet in Mercari.' We think that there's still room for expansion." (Reporter: UEJI, Kentaro).
