> 韓国で、SNSに投稿された知人女性らの顔写真などを人工知能（AI）で合成して作られた精巧な性的画像がインターネット上で拡散し、政府が対策の強化に乗り出している。「ディープフェイク」と呼ばれるこれらの偽画像に関する被害を申告した小中高校生は今年1月以降、200人近くに達した。被害者だけでなく投稿者の側も未成年者が多いといい、深刻な社会問題となっている。

In Korea, graphic sexual images made from pictures with the faces of famous women and using Artificial Intelligence (AI) have proliferated on social media, hence the government's response to strengthen its counter-measures. Since January of this year, the number of elementary and middle school students who've filed reports of having been harmed due to fake images called "Deep Fakes" has reached close to 200 people. It was found that not only the victims are minors. Even the posters themselves are minors. It's a deep social problem. 

>　問題が注目を集めたきっかけは、8月下旬以降、次々に報じられた韓国メディアの報道だ。匿名性の高い通信アプリのテレグラム上に、性的な偽画像のほか、住所や名前などの個人情報を共有するチャットルームが大量にあり、学校別や地域別に分けられていると報じられた。お金を払えば、送った写真をひわいな画像に加工するチャットルームもあり、問題が発覚した時点で約22万人が登録していた。

The problem has received attention because there had been a series of reports on Korean media about this during the latter part of August. On the communications app Telegram where there's a high level of anonymity, other than fake sexual images, large volumes of private information like addresses and names are being shared in chat rooms, and these are said to be even sorted based on school, region, etc. If you pay money, there are also chat rooms where the photo you send can be turned into a scary image. At the time when the problem was found out, it had about 220,000 registered users. 

>　教育省によると、1月から8月27日までに、186人の小中高校生から被害の申告があった。10人の教員からも被害の申告があった。同省は緊急の対応チームを設け、被害状況の把握や心のケアなどにあたっている。

According to the Ministry of Education, from January until August 27, 186 elementary and middle school students have filed reports complaining of being harmed. 10 teachers have also reported their complaints of being harmed. The Ministry has setup an Emergency-Response team to understand the situation and to provide appropriate care.

Korea, which has been promoting digitization, has an abundance of young people who use social media. To prevent harmful misuse of the service, there's a growing call for users to delete the photographs that have their own faces and which they've posted in the past. Tens of people including college students who've been grappling with the problem and groups fighting to protect the rights of women held a meeting on the 29th in Seoul. They voiced out, "What we feel is not embarrassment, but anger." The venue of the meeting was in front of Seoul's Gangnam train station, where a murder incident that targeted nearby women occurred in 2016. A woman said, "By just uploading a photo on social media, my photograph can be stolen for use in deep fake crimes." She complained about "being kept as a potential victim." 

The Korean government has also moved to respond to this problem. President YOON, Suk Yeol has noted during a cabinet meeting on the 27th that it's "clearly a crime." He exuded understanding of the situation, saying, "Anyone can be a victim of digital sex crimes," and sought for stronger supervision.

On the issue of Deep Fakes, it's characteristic that there are many minors posting. According to the Police, last year, there were 120 suspects who've committed crimes related to fake sexual images. 75.8% of these were in their 10's. 

In Korea, incidents that use Telegram to share sex videos to threaten minors had become a huge societal problem from 2019 to 2020. In 2020, the punishment due to sex crimes was revised due to an incident called the "#n room incident", where images of people's faces and their bodies were edited for the purpose of distribution. The penalty is now under 5 years of imprisonment or payment of less than 50 million won (about 5.4 million yen). However, if the intention to distribute is not clear, the person cannot be punished.

At the National Assembly, discussions have continued to further amend the law and provide stricter punishment. It's reported that the ruling party of the government is examining whether to increase the maximum prison sentence from 5 to 7 years.

However, there's high anonymity in Telegram, and it's not easy for investigators to identify the person who posted the image. In addition, even after the problem is found out, a new chat room will be created, and an anonymous user will announce a new fake image post to come. It's become a cat-and-mouse game.
