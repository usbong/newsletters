Giant Publisher KADOKAWA has announced that for the March 2025 period, it forecasts that it'll be losing an estimated amount of 3.6 billion yen due to large-scale RANSOMWARE cyberattacks. System recovery costs and the compensation for creators receiving income from using services like the "niconico video" were reported to have been affected by these attacks, but the company has not clearly stated whether or not it has paid the money demanded by the RANSOMWARE.

In addition, the niconico video service and its book ordering system stopped temporarily due to system failure, such that the company estimates that based on it's sales earnings amounting to 8.4 billion yen, its operating profit has been reduced to 6.4 billion yen.

Because of this, the company has adjusted its forecasted net earnings for the March 2025 period from 13.4 billion yen to 9.7 billion yen (14.8% lower than the previous year). However, its digital books, anime and games businesses are still doing well, with sales amounting to 271.3 billion yen (a 5.1% increase).

The amount affected due to the leakage of private information of its business partners and school directors did not include the compensation that may be given to its "KADOKAWA Dwango Academy" students. The advertising company has taken measures to "sincerely confront this problem" regarding compensation. (ITO, Sho)
