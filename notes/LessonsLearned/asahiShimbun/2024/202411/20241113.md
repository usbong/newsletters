For several years, social worker and author of "A Male-dominated and Female-subjugated, Sexually-addicted Society", SAITO, Akiyoshi (45) has been working on a program to prevent the repetition of sexual assaults committed by over 3000 assailants. He says, "I've also done consultation work on cases where a sexual assault was committed in imitation of scenes in AV."

> 　私が加害者臨床でかかわったケースで、生まれて初めて見たAVが、女子生徒を同級生が追いかけ、セーラー服に精液をかけるものだった、という男性がいます。女子生徒は最初こそ嫌がっていたものの、最後はその行為を喜んでいるように描かれていたとのことです。

I first saw an AV for a clinical case I was handling. In the AV, a female student was being chased by a male classmate, who was saying that her sailor school uniform ought to have semen. While the female student at first hated it, in the end, she was portrayed to have gotten to enjoy the behavior.

> 　中学生だった当人は、こんなことをされて喜ぶ女性がいるんだと衝撃を受けたそうです。高校に入ると同じことを下校時間帯に繰り返し、成人になってからは同種行為で刑務所に何度も服役しました。彼はそのコンテンツに出会わなければ、そのような行為には及ばなかったかもしれないと語っていたのが印象的でした。フィクションであるAVからの誤学習によって、一生を左右された例と言えるでしょう。

The assailant who was a middle school student at the time was said to have been shocked to find out that there's a female who'd enjoy being assaulted in such a manner. When he entered high school, he repeated the same behavior after school hours and even after becoming an adult. He has served prison for that same type of behavior numerous times. What was striking was that in a statement, he said that if he didn't encounter such AV content, he would not have ended up behaving in such a way. From this example, it could be said that a life has been swayed toward another direction after mistakenly learning from fictional AV.

> 　性暴力は学習された行動であり、アダルトコンテンツはそれを強化する要因の一つになっています。

Sexual Violence is a learned behavior. Adult content is a factor that reinforces this.

> 　――アダルトコンテンツに暴力的な演出が少なくないことをどう考えたらいいのでしょうか。

How should we think about Adult content where not a few violent scenes are depicted?

> 　作り手は売れる物をつくりたい。より中毒性のある、支配的で倒錯的なものの方が人の脳に大きなインパクトがあり、ヒットにもつながってきた。男女が対等にセックスする姿は安心・安全を感じることはできても、刺激は薄れるのでしょう。

Its creator wants to make something that can sell. The bestsellers are linked to a subjugating form of perversion that has a huge impact in the mind. Even if the depiction of sex between a man and a women can be seen as safe and secure, there would likely be a thin veil of stimulation present.

> 　あるセクシー俳優の男性から聞いた話ですが、男優も生き残るためには仕事を選べないそうです。食べていくために、ありとあらゆるジャンルのプレーをしないといけない。中には暴力的なものや排泄（はいせつ）物を扱うなど自分がまったく性的関心がわかない分野でも、性的興奮や勃起した状態を保つためにどういうポイントにユーザーの関心があるのか必死でリサーチし、男優自身の中に性的興奮の新しい条件付けの回路を開発し、本番の準備をすることもあるそうです。

A story from a sexy male actor tells of a man who has no other choice but to continue on with his job in order to survive. To be able to eat, he had to play whatever part was available and in all types of genres. Even if his job is in a field that has no relation with sex whatsoever, because the video deals with violent material, he had to go study at which points would users be most affected to be able to maintain sexual arousal, erection, etc. The male actor himself developed a new way to produce sexual arousal, and is said to have prepared himself for the task.

> 　性的な欲求は、学習や条件づけと深くかかわります。業界はそのようなトリガーを作品の中に設定することを繰り返し、顧客を獲得してきたのでしょう。そこへ暴力的な演出が入り込んでいく。

Sexual desire is deeply rooted to learning and the preconditions. The industry repeatedly sets these triggers within the products it creates to most likely acquire viewers. It is for this reason that violence is inserted in the scenes.

> 　そうしたＡＶはポルノ依存症を生み出してもいます。最初は刺激的と感じても、次第に刺激を感じなくなる。ドーパミンへの耐性がさらなる刺激を求め、耽溺（たんでき）していく構図です。そのことは、女性をひとりの人格を持つ対等な人間としてではなく、モノとして扱ってきたこととも大きく関わります。

Such AV produces addiction to pornography. Even if a person felt stimulated at the start, he won't feel so the next time around. So the system has been designed so that viewers would continuously crave and seek for stimulation as their tolerance for dopamine increases. It is mainly here where a female is not a human being, but an object.

> 性加害者の再犯防止プログラムに長年取り組む斉藤章佳さん。日本社会について、「男性は性欲を抑えられない」という価値観が日々強化される、「性欲至上主義」の一面があると指摘します。

SAITO has long been working on a program to prevent sexual assailants from repeating crime. In Japanese society, "males cannot control their sexual desires" is a value that society reinforces daily, indicating a side of "Sexual Hedonism."

> ――温厚な知人男性が、行き交う女性一人ひとりを即座に「やれる」「やれない」と判断していると聞き、衝撃を受けたことがあります。

There are well-informed males who have been surprised to learn the responses of women whom they interacted with and asked to immediately decide whether they "can" or "can't" do something.

Women are turned into sexual objects for man's consumption, something to which males have since become accustomed. Moreover, this has been used to enforce the bond among males.

Meanwhile, there are males who've garnered attention for coming to the side of the females and voicing out a "NO" on social media as protest. While it's still necessary to pay attention to these statements which have words like "discrimination" and "unpleasant", what we find is that what comes first is the sense of protest and outburst, rather than accountability. Therefore, such reactions are merely thoughtless criticisms and are a "backstab" sent by those who actually regard females as objects.

One side of Japan's "Sexual Hedonism"

The Manga Comics Artist TAKINAMI, Yukari has contemplated about Japan's sexual hedonistic side where "a male dominated" society permits the sexual desires of men.

There's a tendency to say that males have difficulty in controlling their sexual desires.

If males really can't control their sexual desires, they shouldn't be able to continue to work at their companies. If they're berated with "You can't control your sexual desires," they should have felt insulted right from the start. However, the view that "males are living things who can't control their sexual desires" has never been negated even today; instead, it's reinforced in society everyday.

Among sexual assailants, not all pertain to erection and semen. On the contrary, from my clinical experience, using sexual excitement as the motivation is among the few minority of those that cause harm. However, when the case elevates to a penal offense, there are quite a number of wives who testify against their husbands when they're asked by investigators regarding their lifestyle and their husband's before the incident. Here, there is bias in that "the husband committed the sexual harm because the wife couldn't manage her husband's sexual desires."

Even the police during investigations would hear of shocking incidents that have occurred because the sexual desires of men could not be controlled. Reporters end up getting police presentations as they are, and "discussions for the reason behind sexual desires" in society are getting even more fixated on the inability of men to control their sexual desires.

However, when people who've committed violent sexual behavior first come for diagnosis, they're asked why they had to resort to such means. Responses included "I wanted to dominate", "I wanted to relieve myself from stress", "a gaming feeling", "a feeling of achievement", and such things but expressed in various words. Sexual violence is an extreme form of vice that is learnable and wherein many varied forms of pleasure are compressed into a short span of time.

Thinking about "I must regularly ejaculate" as a result
