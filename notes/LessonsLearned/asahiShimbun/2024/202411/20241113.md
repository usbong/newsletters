> 　私が加害者臨床でかかわったケースで、生まれて初めて見たAVが、女子生徒を同級生が追いかけ、セーラー服に精液をかけるものだった、という男性がいます。女子生徒は最初こそ嫌がっていたものの、最後はその行為を喜んでいるように描かれていたとのことです。

I first saw an AV for a clinical case that I was handling. In the AV, a female student was being pursued by a male classmate, who was saying that her sailor school uniform ought to have semen. While the female student at first hated it, in the end, she was portrayed to have gotten to enjoy the behavior.

> 　中学生だった当人は、こんなことをされて喜ぶ女性がいるんだと衝撃を受けたそうです。高校に入ると同じことを下校時間帯に繰り返し、成人になってからは同種行為で刑務所に何度も服役しました。彼はそのコンテンツに出会わなければ、そのような行為には及ばなかったかもしれないと語っていたのが印象的でした。フィクションであるAVからの誤学習によって、一生を左右された例と言えるでしょう。

The offender who was a middle school student at the time was said to have been shocked to find out that there's a female who'd enjoy being assaulted in such a manner. When he entered high school, he repeated the same behavior after school hours and even after he became an adult. He has served prison for this same type of behavior numerous times. What was striking was that in a statement, he said that if he didn't encounter such AV content, he would not have ended up behaving in such a way. From this example, it could be said that a life has been swayed toward another direction after mistakenly learning from fictional AV.

> 　性暴力は学習された行動であり、アダルトコンテンツはそれを強化する要因の一つになっています。

Sexual violence is a learned behavior. Adult content is a factor that reinforces this.

> 　――アダルトコンテンツに暴力的な演出が少なくないことをどう考えたらいいのでしょうか。

How should we think about adult content where not a few violent scenes are portrayed?

> 　作り手は売れる物をつくりたい。より中毒性のある、支配的で倒錯的なものの方が人の脳に大きなインパクトがあり、ヒットにもつながってきた。男女が対等にセックスする姿は安心・安全を感じることはできても、刺激は薄れるのでしょう。

Its creator wants to make something that can sell. The bestsellers are linked to a subjugating form of perversion that has a huge impact in the mind. Even if the portrayal of sex between a man and a woman can be seen as safe and secure, it's likely that there would also be a thin layer of sexual arousal present.

> 　あるセクシー俳優の男性から聞いた話ですが、男優も生き残るためには仕事を選べないそうです。食べていくために、ありとあらゆるジャンルのプレーをしないといけない。中には暴力的なものや排泄（はいせつ）物を扱うなど自分がまったく性的関心がわかない分野でも、性的興奮や勃起した状態を保つためにどういうポイントにユーザーの関心があるのか必死でリサーチし、男優自身の中に性的興奮の新しい条件付けの回路を開発し、本番の準備をすることもあるそうです。

A story from a sexy male actor tells of a man who has no other choice but to continue on with his job in order to survive. To be able to eat, he has to play whatever part is available and in all types of genres. Even if his job is in a field that has no relation with sex whatsoever, because the video deals with violent material, he has to go study at which parts would users be most affected to be able to maintain sexual arousal, erection, etc. The male actor himself has developed a new way to produce sexual arousal, and is said to have prepared himself for the task.

> 　性的な欲求は、学習や条件づけと深くかかわります。業界はそのようなトリガーを作品の中に設定することを繰り返し、顧客を獲得してきたのでしょう。そこへ暴力的な演出が入り込んでいく。

Sexual desire is deeply rooted to learning and the preconditions. The industry repeatedly sets these triggers within the products it creates, so that it could acquire viewers. It is for this reason that violence is inserted in the scenes.

> 　そうしたＡＶはポルノ依存症を生み出してもいます。最初は刺激的と感じても、次第に刺激を感じなくなる。ドーパミンへの耐性がさらなる刺激を求め、耽溺（たんでき）していく構図です。そのことは、女性をひとりの人格を持つ対等な人間としてではなく、モノとして扱ってきたこととも大きく関わります。

Such AV produces addiction to pornography. Even if a person felt stimulated at the start, he won't feel so the next time around. So the system has been designed so that viewers would continuously crave and seek for stimulation as their tolerance for dopamine increases. It's mainly here where a female is not a human being, but an object.

> 性加害者の再犯防止プログラムに長年取り組む斉藤章佳さん。日本社会について、「男性は性欲を抑えられない」という価値観が日々強化される、「性欲至上主義」の一面があると指摘します。

Mr. SAITO, Akiyoshi has long been working on a program to prevent sexual offenders from repeating crime. In Japanese society, "males cannot control their sexual desires" is a value that society reinforces daily, indicating a side of "Sexual Hedonism."

> ――温厚な知人男性が、行き交う女性一人ひとりを即座に「やれる」「やれない」と判断していると聞き、衝撃を受けたことがあります。

There are well-informed males who have been surprised to learn the responses of women whom they interacted with and whom they asked to immediately decide whether they "can" or "can't" do something.

## MORE

Women are turned into sexual objects for man's consumption, something to which males have since become accustomed. Moreover, this has been used to enforce the bond among males.

Meanwhile, there are males who've gained attention for coming to the side of the females and voicing out a "No" on social media as protest. While it's still necessary to pay attention to these statements which have words like "discrimination" and "uncomfortable", what we find is that what comes first is the sense of protest and outburst, rather than accountability. Therefore, such reactions are merely thoughtless criticisms and are a "backstab" launched by those who actually regard females as objects.

## One side of Japan's "Sexual Hedonism"

The Manga Comics Artist TAKINAMI, Yukari has contemplated about this hedonistic side of Japan where "a male-dominated" society permits the sexual desires of men.

There's a tendency to say that males have difficulty in controlling their sexual appetites.

If males really can't control their sexual desires, they shouldn't be able to continue to work at their jobs. If they're berated with "You can't control your sexual appetite," they should have felt insulted right from the start. However, the view that "males are living things who can't control their sexual desires" has never been negated even today; instead, it's reinforced in society everyday.

Among sexual offenders, not all pertain to erection and semen. On the contrary, from my clinical experience, using sexual excitement as the motivation is among the minority of those cases that inflict harm. However, when the case is escalated to a penal offense, there are quite a number of wives who testify against their husbands when they're asked by investigators regarding their lifestyle and their husband's before the occurrence of the incident. Here, there is bias in that "the husband committed the sexual offense, because the wife couldn't manage her husband's sexual appetite."

Even the police during investigations would hear of shocking incidents that have occurred because the sexual desires of men could not be controlled. Reporters end up getting police presentations as they are, and "discussions for the reason behind sexual desires" in society are getting even more fixated on the inability of men to control their sexual appetites.

When people who've committed violent sexual acts first come for diagnosis, they're asked why they had to resort to such means. Responses included "I wanted to dominate", "I wanted to relieve myself from stress", "a gaming sense of experience", "a feeling of achievement", and such things expressed in various words. Sexual violence is an extreme form of vice that is learnable and wherein many varied forms of pleasure are compressed into a short span of time.

## Getting stuck in the thought that as a result, "I must regularly ejaculate"

With regard to power relations, according to a former Osaka District Chief Prosecutor's case where an offender attempted to rape the victim, if structures exist for violence to occur, sexual violence could happen anywhere. Upon considering this scenario, Japanese society uses sexual desires as a magic pill in sex scandals for its efficacy in cleverly hiding accountability.

In a rehabilitation program for people who've compulsively committed sexual offenses because they cannot control their sexual behavior, there has also been a proposal for them "to try to stop masturbating in a period of one month." While there are people who worry that "it'll be a distressful undertaking," in truth, there are many who voice out that it was actually "weirdly the opposite," and "it was, on the contrary, easy." This realization can be attained if the statement that "it's easier to produce deviant behavior when sexual desires accumulate because the person doesn't regularly masturbate" doesn't move beyond the realm of thought.

It's likely that not a few people habitually use AV to masturbate "before sexual desires accumulate too much." Actually, that itself is something that I'd want to point out as having a money-draining aspect especially for people who sexually behave compulsively and struggle with the problem of sexual addiction.

First of all, what is this desire to harm others?

When the problem of not being valued by other people or the feeling of loneliness after being pursued and having one's self-respect damaged become psychological, it's easy for the person to self-explode and behave wildly. Their self-worth and self-respect return by hurting other people and dominating those who are weaker than themselves. "Sadism" is not restricted only to males; it's a normal desire among human beings.

To be able to control that desire when conversing with friends and people whom one values is a mark of a mature adult. However, I think that violence and such suppressed desires come out quite frequently in adult content.

## A more important question
 
I think that it's never really the case that we should regard "violent expression in adult videos as unavoidable and that they exist for the sake of letting loose one's sexual desires." Wouldn't it be more important to examine the impact of violence and bad behavior in adult content and discuss these from various points of view?

When speaking about evaluating AV, I think that while focusing on the process hits the mark, what ought to be really asked is actually something rather different. Quite a number of adult content would have scenes that portray a young and minor-looking actress, who is short-in-height, carrying her school bag on her back. I think that it would be better if we examine critically people's tolerance and goading of this form of expression where children are made into sex objects.

However, even after enforcing stricter monitoring, management and evaluation, the situation is as it has been with regulating dangerous drugs in the past; the task is, in fact, a cat-and-mouse game. Eventually, the side of the viewers, who are the receivers of information, will realize that any harm inflicted should exclude themselves. Therefore, it's important to ask how people choose information. To nurture this capacity is education. 

Two years ago, when I was doing clinical work with sexual offenders, Ms. SAKURAI, Yuko, a midwife, and I began working on an inclusive form of sexual education that employs a viewpoint without gender-bias. This was initiated by a strong desire on my part to address the issue after having been told by the offenders at the time, "Our only sex education textbook was AV. We want to formally study sex."

Sex education is based on human rights like procreation, gender, private zones and sexual agreements, which include the age when to have sexual intercourse, but without any prejudice whatsoever such as "Women should do this to be happy", "Sex is done in this way." 

While I've found that it's possible to study sex at any age, what's important above all is to create opportunities for learning starting from childhood, well before victims are produced. (TSUKUE, Misuzu; TANAKA, Elena)

## Thoughts from Readers

Since a long time ago, I've jeopardized my relationship with people like my partner and my girlfriend after saying something embarrassing and thoughtless and which I said simply out of curiosity. Even now, I answer my own questions whenever I'd wonder if I would hurt women without realizing it. Since birth, I've worried about how to confront this inner desire to harm others, which is like an installed app that cannot be removed. (30s)

Japan's AV have a tendency to depict women as "mere holes" and are mainly for men. Accepting and beautifying perversion and rape have also made an impact in sexual crimes committed in actuality. We need to acknowledge the mistake brought about by the deluge of wrong information. Sex education is necessary for males and females to respect each other. (50s)

I feel that this desire to dominate in AV and erotic Manga Comics, as well as the emptiness that follows go in the same line of thought as the sexual harm inflicted during the war. Even males who've experienced power-tripping harassment in the military have somehow kept their self-respect intact by inflicting sexual harm on the women in their target location of attack. Nowadays, there are many males who attempt to solve the problem of misogamy by not acknowledging their duty to head the patriarchal family. (60's)
