>　20年ぶりとなる新しい紙幣が3日、発行された。1万円札は渋沢栄一、5千円札は津田梅子、千円札は北里柴三郎の肖像が描かれている。「大量に流通するお札としては、今回が最後になるのではないか」。日本銀行出身の中島真志・麗沢大教授は、こう予測する。近年はキャッシュレス化が急激に進み、若者を中心に現金にふれる機会も減ってきた。次の変更も20年後だとすれば2044年。その頃には、お札ではない、新たな「通貨」が登場しているかもしれない。

A new paper bill has been released to the public on the 3rd of July, after 20 long years. For the 10,000 bill, the portrait of SHIBUSAWA, Eiichi has been drawn on the bill, while for the 5,000 bill, TSUDA, Umeko, and for the 1000 bill KITASATO, Shibasaburo. "This will likely be the last time that the bills will be distributed in such large quantities," Prof. NAKAJIMA, Masashi from Reitaku University and the Bank of Japan says sharing his prediction. As cashless payments rapidly proliferate, young people in particular have lesser chance of using cash payments. If the next change of bills will also take 20 years, it'll be in 2044. By that time, there won't be any more bills in circulation; instead, a new "currency" would have likely been introduced by then.

>　経済産業省によると、23年のキャッシュレス決済比率は39.3%で、13年（15.3%）から2.6倍に拡大した。

According to the Ministry of Economy, Trade and Industry, the ratio of cashless payments grew 39.3% in 2023, 2.6 times the 15.3% in 2013.

>　さらに現金離れを加速させるかもしれないのが「デジタル通貨（CBDC）」だ。お札や硬貨を電子上でやりとりする通貨のことで、スマートフォンのアプリやQRコードなどを使った利用が想定される。現金からCBDCに移行すれば、中央銀行は、紙幣の印刷や流通コストを節約でき、銀行はATMの削減を進められる。

Furthermore, what may be accelerating cashless payments are the "Central Bank Digital Currencies (CBDC)". The digital exchange of bills, coins, among others is supposedly done using technologies like Smartphone apps and QR Codes. By moving from cash to CBDC, the central bank can save on the cost of printing and distributing paper bills, while banks can push forward the reduction of their ATMs.

>　民間のキャッシュレス決済の場合、小売店が端末を導入し、決済会社に手数料を支払う必要がある。CBDCはそのような手間を省けるのが特徴で、「いつでもどこでも」送金できる。

In the case of cashless payments, terminals were brought into small shops which, in turn, need to pay the service provider a handling fee. CBDC, in particular, can eliminate such types of hassle, so that payments can be done "whenever and wherever."

In Japan, while it's not yet been decided when the "Digital Yen" will be introduced, actual tests and such things are already in-progress. In April 2023, along with the three mega-banks, system tests to make money transfers have started, and the plan is to finish these tests within several years. In April of this year, even the government has presented to the public the current issues with the digital yen, and has been examining its compatibility with the necessary revisions in the law to bring in the new technology.

There are also examples of progress overseas. In Central-America, the Central Bank in the Bahamas has started CBDC's "Sand Dollar" in October 2020. While the People's Bank of China has begun to test transactions of the "Digital Yuan of the People's Republic of China" in a part of the city. The European Central Bank (ECB) has also presented last year a policy for the EU on the "Digital Euro", and has started discussions at the European Parliament since this year.

The head of the Ministry of Finance says, "If its introduction overseas pushes forward, it would be necessary to prepare for its immediate application." On the other hand, there are also many issues like cyber-attacks and data privacy protection that also need to be addressed.

Digital currency has changed in form in response to technological advancements. About 1000 years ago, paper bills were also introduced in response to advancements in printing technology. Reitaku University's Mr. NAKAJIMA points out, "For the digitization of society to advance forward, it would be necessary to have a convenient currency that is applicable with the times."
