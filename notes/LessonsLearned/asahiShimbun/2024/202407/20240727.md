A popular food at the Shiojiri School in Nagano Prefecture, the "KIMUTAKU" is an onigiri made from fried rice, and is sold by the large convenience store Seven-Eleven in both Nagano and Yamanashi prefectures for a short period of time. City Mayor TAKASHI, Momose says that since more tourists come to both prefectures during summer vacation, "We want plenty of people to taste the Shiojiri flavor."

The city presented the product during a planned press meeting on the 25th. Its name is the "KIMUTAKU Fried Rice Ball" and its pre-tax price is at 130yen (approx 65PHP). Seven-Eleven has been selling the KIMUTAKU rice ball intermittently since 2012, and this will be its first year since it was last sold four years ago.

The KIMUTAKU school lunch is rice mixed with ideas from the home, says a nutritionist working at the Shiojiri City Middle School. "We want to convey the taste of home to sons who are weak with side dishes, so that they may enjoy them with their grandparent's generation." Since 2002, it has been provided as a school lunch within the city. Even now, the rice ball is launched two or three times per year. Its naming comes from the imagination of TV Artist Mr. KIMURA, Takuya, who also presented it in TV shows.

This time, there are more pickled radish known as the "TAKUWAN" put into the onigiri, and due to the large cuts, "The taste of the pickled radish could be enjoyed even further," the spokesperson from Seven-Eleven says.

Previously, the onigiri's product name was not "KIMUTAKU", but "KIMU-taku". Explained by the spokesperson from Seven-Eleven, "This is to strengthen the image of the "TAKUWAN", the pickled radish."

Starting July 30, approximately 450 stores within Nagano Prefecture will be selling the product, while within Yamanashi prefecture about 200 stores will begin selling the onigiri starting August 13. Its sale time period is set at present to be until the end of August. (KOYAMA, Yuichi)
