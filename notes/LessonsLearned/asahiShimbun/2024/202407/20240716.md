>　野菜と果物はうつ症状の予防に効果があるとされているが、野菜・果物ジュースはむしろリスクになりうることが、国立精神・神経医療研究センター精神保健研究所の成田瑞（ずい）・精神機能研究室長らのグループによる研究でわかった。100%濃縮還元でも生産工程で加糖され、砂糖によって神経細胞が機能するのに必要なたんぱく質が減ったり、炎症作用があったりすることが考えられるという。

While vegetables and fruits are effective in preventing depression, research led by Mr. NARITA, Zui, the Chief Researcher of the Mental Health Research Laboratory at the National Psychiatry and Neurological Treatment Research Center, along with research chiefs at the Psychiatric Research Laboratory group, have found that vegetable and fruit juices, in contrast, do have potential risk. Even those drinks that are 100% concentrated have sugar added during production, which decreases the protein necessary for nerve cells to function. Inflammation is also considered to occur as a side-effect.

>　コーヒーもブラックコーヒーの摂取量が多い人はうつ症状のリスクが低いが、砂糖入りだとリスクが高いことも示された。

While the risk of depression for people who consume plenty of black coffee is low, it's been shown that the risk is raised by adding sugar. 

>　2011～16年に秋田、岩手、茨城、長野、高知、愛媛、長崎の7県に暮らし、うつ病のほか、うつ病との関連が報告されているがんや心筋梗塞（こうそく）、糖尿病の患者らを除いた40～74歳の約9万5千人に生活習慣について尋ねた。5年後にもアンケートを受けた8万人余りのうち1万8172人にうつ症状が見られた。

Between 2011 to 2016, the researchers asked the lifestyle of about 95,000 people whose ages ranged between 40 and 74 years old, and lived in seven prefectures including Akita, Iwate, Ibaraki, Nagano, Kochi, Ehime and Kawasaki. Except those with depression, the participants did not include patients with diabetes, heart problems, cancer, and illnesses that have been reported to be related to depression. Even five years ago, from the over 80,000 people who took the survey, 18,172 people were considered to have depression.

>　甘味飲料全体と炭酸飲料、野菜ジュース、100%果物ジュース、砂糖入りコーヒー、ブラックコーヒー、緑茶でそれぞれの摂取量を計算し、全く飲まない人▽少し摂取する人▽中くらい摂取する人▽多く摂取する人――の4グループにわけて、うつ症状との関連を調べた。地域や年齢、性別、体格指数（BMI）、喫煙の有無、飲酒頻度、運動（歩行時間）などの影響を取り除く手法で分析した。

The researchers computed the amount of sweetened beverages, carbonated drinks, vegetable juices, 100% concentrated fruit juices, coffee with sugar and green tea consumed by the participants and divided them into four groups: 1) never drinks, 2) drinks a little, 3) moderately drinks, and 4) drinks a lot. They investigated its relationship with depression, doing the analysis after removing the impact of region, age, sex, Body Mass Index (BMI), smoker or non-smoker, frequency of drinking alcoholic beverages, exercise (walking time), etc. 

>　その結果、甘味飲料全体と炭酸飲料、野菜ジュース、100%果物ジュース、砂糖入りコーヒーのそれぞれで、全く飲まない人に比べ、摂取する人はうつ症状のリスクが統計上明確に高く出た。

The result of which is that when compared to people who never drink any of the beverages, those who do clearly have a higher risk of having depression.

>　具体的には、多く摂取する人は全く飲まない人に比べて、甘味飲料全体で3.6ポイント、炭酸飲料で3.5ポイント、野菜ジュースで2.3ポイント、100%果物ジュースで2.4ポイント、砂糖入りコーヒーで2.6ポイント、リスクが高く出た。

More specifically, comparing those who drink a lot with those who never drank, results showed that they have a high risk with 3.6 percentile points for all sweetened beverages, 3.5 points for carbonated drinks, 2.3 points for vegetable juices, 2.4 points for 100% fruit juices, and 2.6 points for coffee with added sugar. 

>　一方、ブラックコーヒーは摂取する人の方がリスクが低く、多く摂取する人は全く飲まない人より1.7ポイント低く出た。コーヒーには、カフェインによる抗酸化作用や抗炎症作用があるが、砂糖が加わると逆の影響が強まると考えられるという。

Meanwhile, the risk for people who drink black coffee is lower, and results showed that those who drink a lot have 1.7 points lower risk. While caffeine from coffee has anti-oxidant and anti-inflammatory effects, adding sugar is considered to increase its adverse effects.

Regarding green tea, no clear difference in the risk was seen based on the results of the study.

Mr. NARITA points out, "While vegetables and fruits help in preventing depression, they can show the opposite effect when consumed as  beverages. We also found that drinking black coffee with sugar creates precisely this opposite effect." "As a whole, it's considered that the reduction of in-take of sweetened drinks and those with plenty of sugar is considered to be good for preventing depression. It's also difficult to consider that squeezed vegetables and fruits to make juices are bad; however, we want people to understand that 100% concentrated juices easily obtained from vending machines are completely different from those drinks made originally from vegetables and fruits, because even if the juices were extracted, there are cases where sugar was added to the beverages to adjust their sweetness.

The results of the research study have been published in the clinical nutrition studies specialist magazine (https://doi.org/10.1016/j.clnu.2024.04.017; last accessed: 20240716). (SAKURAI, Rintaro)
