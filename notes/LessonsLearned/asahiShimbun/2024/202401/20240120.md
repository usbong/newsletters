>　東京都足立区千住緑町3丁目の住宅の床下で18日、2人の遺体が見つかった事件で、警視庁は19日、フィリピン国籍で職業不詳のモラレス・ヘイゼル・アン・バギシャ容疑者（30）=同区千住龍田町=を死体遺棄容疑で逮捕し、発表した。「私は知りません」と容疑を否認しているという。

The remains of two bodies were found underneath the flooring of a residential housing in Block 3 Senju Midori Town, in Adachi district, Tokyo City. Living in the same district in Tatsuta town, Morales Hazel Ann BAGISHA (30) was arrested for having been suspected of abandoning the remains. The suspect has denied the allegation: "I don't know."

>　捜査1課などによると、モラレス容疑者は16日ごろ、この住宅に住む自営業の高橋徳弘さん（55）と、妻で無職の希美江さん（52）の遺体を住宅内に遺棄した疑いがある。事件後、福島県内のホテルにいるモラレス容疑者を、警視庁の捜査員が発見したという。

Investigation Unit#1, among others, say that the suspect, Morales, is suspected of abandoning the remains of the bodies of Mr TAKAHASHI, Norihiro (55), self-employed and who lived in the residential housing with his wife, Ms Kimie (52), unemployed. After the incident, the suspect was reported to have been found by Police Investigators in a hotel within FUKUSHIMA prefecture.

>　捜査関係者によると、2人の遺体には、胸や腹などに刃物で刺されたような傷が複数あった。2人は床下収納のボックスの下のコンクリート上で、シートにくるまれた状態で見つかった。

According to investigators, the two bodies had numerous wounds from knife stabs to the stomach and chest. The two were found wrapped in a sheet above the concrete inside the storage box underneath the floor. 

>　16日夜以降、モラレス容疑者が同区内の自宅近くのゴミ置き場で、別の人物と一緒に血の付いた服などを捨てる姿が防犯カメラに映っていた。服は高橋さん夫妻のものとみられ、同課はこの人物も事件について事情を知っているとみている。

After the evening of the 16th, the suspect, Morales, was caught on CCTV Camera with another person throwing clothing tinged with blood at a garbage collection site near their house within the same district. Because the clothing appeared to be from the husband and wife TAKAHASHI, Investigators consider the person to be also knowledgeable regarding facts about the incident.

>　夫婦と同居する30代の長男が以前、モラレス容疑者と交際していたことも判明。昨秋以降に長男らから、容疑者との数十万円の金銭トラブルなどの相談が千住署に寄せられており、関連を慎重に調べる。長男は16日午後8時50分ごろ、「帰宅すると両親がおらず、自宅内の床に血痕を見つけた」と110番通報していた。（増山祐史、遠藤美波、長妻昭明）

The 30-year old eldest son who lived with the husband and wife previously had confirmed having interacted with the suspect Morales. Since after the previous Autumn, the eldest son had visited Senjuu with the suspect to consult regarding money problems amounting to several hundred thousands of yen. The relationship of the two is carefully being investigated. The eldest son had called the Police (#110) at 08:50 PM on the 16th saying, "When I came home, my parents were not around, and I found blood stains on the floor inside the house."

### USBONG NOTE

1) Tell-tale heart; Edgar Allan POE

2) How does cousin, SYSON, Ryan, make money? With two male children before death of Grandmother (Chinese side) in 2017, he shall need assistance from close family members, e.g. his sister, SYSON, Joan, who, in turn, receive money from those who do.

Intending to drive smuggled, luxury vehicles, SYSON, Ryan would have a driver's license and shall go for doing undocumented jobs related to driving vehicles.

Vans such as on the photo and used in public transport in the Philippines come to mind.

In addition, because such driving jobs, poorly documented, if at all, are seasonal, this observation explains the continuous noise pollution, even during the early morning. More unsolicited distractions to cause problems to those who already have jobs and are working.

3) empiricism
