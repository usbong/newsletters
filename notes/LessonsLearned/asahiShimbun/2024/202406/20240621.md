>　宇宙航空研究開発機構（JAXA）が昨年6月以降、複数回のサイバー攻撃を受けていたことが朝日新聞の取材で判明した。機密指定を受けた大量の情報が外部に流出した恐れがある。

The Japan Aerospace Exploration Agency (JAXA) has been confirmed by Asahi Shimbun to have been receiving numerous cyberattacks since June of the past year. There's apprehension that large amounts of classified information may have already been leaked outside.

> ハッカー集団は、JAXA内部の機密情報を盗み取ることが狙いとみられる。米マイクロソフト社のクラウドサービス「マイクロソフト365」に不正アクセスし、幹部職員らの保有する文書ファイルがハッカーに不正に閲覧されたり、外部に持ち出されたりした可能性がある。

The hacker group is considered to have been aiming at stealing classified information within JAXA. Microsoft's Cloud Service "Microsoft 365" was illegally accessed, and documents from the heads of staff were illegally viewed. There's even possibility that these classified files were brought outside.

>　これらは、サイバーエスピオナージ（電子的なスパイ活動）と呼ばれる活動の一環とみられる。不正アクセスされたファイルには、秘密保持契約（NDA）を結んだ米航空宇宙局（NASA）やトヨタ自動車、防衛省などとやりとりした機密情報も含まれていたという。

These attacks are considered to be Cyber-espionage (digital spying activities). The files that were illegally accessed were reported to have included digital correspondences classified to be under Non-disclosure Agreements (NDA) between NASA, Toyota Motors and the Defense Agency, among others.

>　なぜ繰り返しJAXAは狙われたのか。それは、JAXAが持つ科学技術と知的財産、そして政府の情報収集衛星の開発を担うなど国の防衛や安全保障に直結する事業領域が影響していると考えられる。

Why is JAXA being repeatedly targeted? The reason is considered to be because of the impact in the business region that is tied to security and safety and the national defense which is responsible for scientific technologies, knowledge assets, and also the development of government satellites to gather information. 

>　JAXAもウイルス対策ソフトの導入やネットワーク監視など、一通り厳重なセキュリティー対策を講じてきたはずだ。だが、ハッカー集団の手口は想定を超えたといえる。

JAXA has also installed anti-virus software and does network security monitoring, among others, and should have already taken strict security measures against any cyberattack. However, the hacker group's modus operandi was said to have exceeded their expectations.

## MORE


These measures are now being questioned after a modus illegally infiltrated JAXA's network. This time, the numerous cyberattacks eventually hacked the Virtual Private Network (VPN) and was reported to have infiltrated JAXA's internal network. There's a high possibility that a hidden defect (vulnerability) was exploited. The hacker's technical level was high and it's not easy to prevent an attack that couldn't be detected as before. 

While JAXA has a huge responsibility for the nation, it has also been suffering from cyberattacks, one in 2013 and another in 2016. Regarding the casualty in 2016, the head of police named during a meeting with reporters in April 2021 the "Tick" Hacker group that supports the Chinese Liberation Army for being the likely culprit involved in the aforementioned cyberattacks. Japan's investigation unit spoke of this for the first time at the national level.

This time, too, based on the modus of the cyberattack and the trace of the virus that was found, among others, the name of the hacker group that was identified to have connections with the Chinese government has come up.

Were JAXA's security measures enough? As an organization that has been established to bring together three space agencies, and carries the great responsibility for the varying factors involved in the safety and security of the nation including a closed defense system and an open scientific and technological research community, JAXA is now questioned on how far its monitoring system against cyberattacks could reach. Examination is necessary. (Editorial Staff: SUDO, Tatsuya)
