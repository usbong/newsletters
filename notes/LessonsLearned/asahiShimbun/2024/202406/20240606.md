Japan's declining birthrate is not stopping. The number of Japanese children born in 2023 as well as the total birthrate for the year have again reached their lowest in record history. The accelerating decline of the national birthrate has been attributed to the huge impact brought about by the decrease of marrying people.

>　婚姻数は1970年ごろは年間100万組を超えていたが、2011年以降は年間60万組台でしばらく推移。コロナ禍に見舞われた20年は前年比12.3%減と大きく減り、23年は同6.0%減の47万4717組と、日本人の婚姻数は戦後初めて50万組を割り込んだ。

While the number of married people has surpassed 1 million per year in 1970, after 2011, it has moved down to 600,000 per year. During the Corona Pandemic in 2020, this number tremendously decreased by 12.3% as compared to the previous year's. In 2023, with the number decreasing by 6% and with married couples totaling to 474,717, it was the first time after the war that the number of married Japanese people was at 500,000 couples. 

>　一方、結婚した夫婦が持つ子どもの数を示す「完結出生児数」は、1970年代から2.2前後で推移し、21年も最低値を更新したものの1.9と大きくは変わっていない。日本は婚外子が少なく、専門家は少子化の主な要因の一つを「未婚化」と指摘する。国立社会保障・人口問題研究所の資料によると、20年の「50歳時の未婚率」は男性が約28%、女性が約18%に上昇。結婚しない人は増加傾向だ。

The number of children that married couples have (the number of children after marriage) since the 1970s has moved to around 2.2, in 2021, it reached its lowest at 1.9 and has not largely changed at all. In Japan, the number of children outside of marriage is low, and experts say that the main reason for the declining birthrate is because there has been an increase in "unmarried people". According to data from the National Social Welfare and Population Research Center, "The rate of unmarried people in their 50's" for males has climbed up to about 28%, while it's about 18% for females in 2020. There has been an increasing trend of people not marrying.

>　人口減少に歯止めがかからない地方では、自治体の結婚支援にも熱が入る。08年に結婚支援センターを設け、いち早く対策に乗り出した愛媛県。お見合い事業と婚活イベントを軸に、24年1月末までに支援した計1500組のカップルから結婚の報告があったという。

In places where the reduction in the population cannot be stopped, there has been an increase in matrimonial support from local government units. In 2008, Ehime prefecture setup a matrimonial support center, and quickly joined in the countermeasures. Focusing on arranged marriages and matrimonial activities, they were reported to have helped a total of 1,500 couples by January 2024.

>　こうした「官製婚活」には「個人の問題に行政は介入すべきでない」という批判もあるが、国の後押しもあって全国に広がる。愛媛県の担当者は「未婚者へのアンケートで8割弱が『いずれ結婚するつもり』と答える一方、周りに同世代の未婚異性がいないという人が約3割いた。本人に希望があるのであれば、伴走型の支援を届けたい」。

Having the backing of the national government, these arranged marriage activities have spread nationwide, even if there are also critics saying that "government ought not to intervene with private issues." A spokesperson from Ehime Prefecture says, "Based on a survey aimed at unmarried people, under 80% of the respondents answered, 'I intend to marry eventually.', while about 30% said that there aren't any unmarried persons of the opposite sex and of the same generation near where they are. If the person himself has hope, we want to reach out to him and provide the accompanying support."

>　ただ、子どもを持つことに対する意識には変化が見られ、少子化対策は一筋縄ではいかない。21年実施の出生動向基本調査でも、「結婚したら子どもを持つべきだ」と答えた未婚者の割合は6年前の調査から急減し、未婚者が将来ほしいと考える子どもの数も減り続けている。

However, simply seeing change in people consciousness on whether or not to have children, it doesn't necessarily mean that countermeasures against the declining birthrate would be simple to implement. Even in basic research on childbirth trends done in 2021, there has been a rapid decrease in the number of unmarried people who answered, "If I marry, I ought to have children." This is as compared to research done six years ago. In addition, the number of children that unmarried people think that they want in the future has also continued to decrease.

Family and Social Studies Prof. YAMADA, Masahiro of Chuo University says that regarding the accelerating decline in the birthrate, "Since several years ago, the baby boomer junior generation has started to fall behind the childbearing age." As the gap spreads among among young people, there are people who procrastinate in their decisions when they think that 'They won't be able to live their usual life after marriage and childbirth.' While there are no drastic countermeasures apt to provide child nurturing support to high school dropouts, freelancers, self-employed people, the declining childbirth in Japan will not stop."

The impact on the annual pension?

The public system's annual pension was created so that the older generation is supported by the current generation. What do people see when they consider the impact of the ceaseless decrease in childbirth?

The Ministry of Health, Labor and Welfare has put a "limit" to its impact. The National Social Welfare and Population Research Center estimates that comparing the numbers before the Corona Pandemic with those of the same year, the pace of increase in foreigners in Japan was about 160,000 people. Looking at the population as a whole, the impact of this to the annual pension is expected to be weakening.

However, concerning the inflow of foreigners, there's doubt that it'll return to numbers before the Corona Pandemic.

Regarding the relationship between birthrate and the annual pension, Prof. TAMAKI, Shinsuke from the Junior College Department of Ohtsuma Women's University (and who is also the Annual Pension Chief of the Ministry of Health, Labor and Welfare) points out, "We don't only argue against reducing birthrate, there's also a need to look at all the variables including employment activities."

Along with low birthrates, while the age of Japan's child bearing population (15~64 years old) peaked in 1995 and has continuously decreased, there has been  "an increasing number of people supporting the annual pension."

A big portion of this is due to the increase of working females and older people. According to the Japan Institute for Labor Policy and Training  (JILPT), an independent agency, the rate of employment in 2010 was at 56.7%, but rose to 60.4% in 2020. If the current situation is maintained, the rate of employment is estimated to be 56.9% in 2040. In the event that women and older people who join the labor force continue to steadily increase, the number will be 62.9%, and is seen to increase to 66.4% along with more progress and development.

According to statistics from the national government, the employment rate of old people over 65 years old in 2022 was 25.2%. 50.8% were 65~69 years old, while 33.5% were 70~74 years old, either of which was at its highest in record history. Looking at the distribution of the "Comparative Rates of the Labor Force Population", women in the early half of their 30s occupied 49.5% in 1982, and has grown to 80.6% in 2022. 

Prof. TAMAGI says, "Having workers means that there are people who can support the annual pension." (TAKA, Ayami)
