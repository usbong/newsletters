>　地域のがん医療の拠点となっている病院の約98%が、認知症のがん患者への対応で困ったことがあるという調査結果を、日本対がん協会がまとめた。高齢化が進み、認知症のあるがん患者が増えているが、対策が追いついていない実態が浮かんだ。

The Japanese Anti-Cancer Association has compiled the results of a study showing that about 98% of hospitals that have become the region's medical treatment base have difficulty in addressing dementia among Cancer patients. While the number of Cancer patients who have dementia increases as the population grows older, counter-measures could not keep up with the situation.

>　調査は2023年4～6月、全国のがん診療連携拠点病院約450施設に郵送とウェブで実施。57%にあたる256施設から有効回答があった。

The study was done from April to June of 2023, and was conducted by sending snail mail and using the web to contact about 450 facilities that are base hospitals involved with the diagnosis of Cancer nationwide. 256 (57%) of these facilities responded.

>　「認知症のがん患者への対応で困ったことがあるか」の問いに「はい」と答えたのは、98%にあたる250施設で、「いいえ」は6施設だった。

As answer to the question on "Have you had difficulty in addressing Cancer patients with dementia," 98% of the 250 facilities responded with "Yes", while only 6 facilities responded with "No".

>　「はい」と答えた施設に、どんな事例かを複数回答で選んでもらうと、「本人が治療について判断できない」が93%と最も多かった。次いで「在宅での治療を支える家族がいない」77%。ほかに、「在宅での抗がん剤治療の副作用などを周囲に伝えることができない」64%、「適切な食事管理ができない」63%、「入院中のリハビリを拒否する」60%などが多かった。

The facilities that answered "Yes" were further asked for an example of an incident and had to choose from several choices. The most which garnered 93% answered, "The person himself cannot decide on the treatment." Next, 77% said, "No family member supports the treatment at home." As for the rest, 64% answered, "The side-effects of the anti-cancer treatment and so on cannot be conveyed to those nearby," while for the 63%, "Appropriate food management cannot be done." Finally, as many as 60% chose, "While hospitalized, the patient refuses rehabilitation."

A study to verify if there's dementia becomes an invaluable resource in decision-making to determine the cancer treatment policy.


22% of the facilities responded that before and after being admitted to the hospital, they conducted screening tests to verify if the patient has dementia. Regarding the mental wellbeing of the Cancer patients with dementia, 48% of the facilities have transferred the patients for home treatment after being discharged from the hospital.

It is possible to bring out hope from the majority of the cases

As a participant of the study, Chief KOGAWA, Asao of the National Cancer Research Center at the East Hospital Mental Tumor Surgical Unit says, "For a study on dementia before and after admission to the hospital, 20% is few. In general, during the acute stage at the hospital, counter-measures against dementia arrive late. Eventually, during these past several years, there has been a push to have senior citizens already grasp their illness by the time they are admitted in the hospital."

In addition, we've learned that it would be easier to support the quality of life during treatment and not have it decline if it's possible to communicate with the person himself to evaluate and verify whether the patient has a problem in memory, depression or isolation.

Chief KOGAWA points out, "Even with dementia, we cannot opt not to decide, and not know what to do. If the physician can explain the situation using words that are easy to understand, we can bring out hope in the majority of the people."

After Cancer treatment, there are many cases when various symptoms like lethargy and insomnia appear. However, currently, what has become the topic of discussion is the lack of support for patients discharged from the hospital to survive. "It's important to deepen the relationship between hospitals and the region to provide support, so that the person himself can live in the place that he desires and with peace of mind." (TSUJIGAI, Noriko)
