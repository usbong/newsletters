> 東京大の西増弘志教授らと米アーク研究所のグループは、特殊な酵素を使ってDNAを組み換える仕組みを解明し、英科学誌ネイチャーに発表した。ゲノムを改変する次世代の道具に応用できそうだという。

Prof. NISHIMASU, Hiroshi of the University of Tokyo and the team at the U.S. Arc Research Institute have brought to light the mechanism that can recombine the DNA using a special enzyme, and have presented this in the English Science Magazine Nature. It was reported that it appears that this could be further applied to create a next-generation tool to change the genome. 

>　ゲノムを改変する技術として、2020年にノーベル化学賞が贈られた「CRISPR（クリスパー）/Cas9（キャスナイン）」が知られるが、長いDNA配列を特定の場所に挿入するといった大規模な改変はむずかしかった。

As a technology that changes the genome, it has garnered attention after receiving the Nobel Prize for Chemistry in 2020 for "CRISPR/Cas9". However, it was difficult to achieve large-scale changes where insertions are done in specific portions of a long DNA sequence.

>　グループは、自分のDNA配列を切り出して、別の場所に挿入する「動く遺伝子」があることに注目。大腸菌を使ってこの組み換えのメカニズムにかかわるDNA配列を詳しく調べた。

The group cut out their own DNA sequences and focused on a "gene for movement" that they inserted into another portion of the DNA. Using the Escherichia coli, the team investigated in detail the DNA sequence that is involved in the mechanism that does this recombination.

>　その結果、組み換えにかかわる酵素のほか、切り出す部分と組み込む部分を橋渡しするRNAが重要な役割を果たすことを突き止めた。

Aside from the enzyme that is involved in the recombination, they found as a result of this the RNA whose main role is to bridge the part that removes and the part that combines. 

## MORE


Experimenting with the Cryo-Electron microscope, the team was also able to capture the process that changes the DNA sequence using this enzyme and the RNA bridge. 


By changing the bridge RNA's sequence, the team learned that the place where the DNA is removed and the place where it is combined can also be freely altered.


While subsequent research is necessary to know whether this discovery with the Escherichia coli can be applied to mammals, using this mechanism, it is now possible to do simple steps, such as freely specifying a particular portion, where a DNA sequence is inserted, cut and moved.


Dr. Patrick HSU of the ARC Research Institute says, "This has various possible applications including safe gene therapy."


The thesis was presented on the 27th in the English Science Magazine Nature.
