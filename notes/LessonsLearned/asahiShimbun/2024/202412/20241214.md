> オムロンが開発している卓球ロボット「フォルフェウス」が13日、パリ五輪の卓球団体で銀メダルを獲得した張本美和選手と対戦した。フォルフェウスはセンサーや人工知能（AI）などオムロンの技術力を結集し、ラリーを続けることができるロボット。だが、世界トップクラスの選手ともなると、球の回転もスピードもケタ違い。果たして、打ち返せたのか。

"FORPHEUS", the Robopong developed by OMRON, played ping-pong with Paris Olympics Silver Medalist Ms. HARIMOTO, Miwa. FORPHEUS is a robot that harnesses OMRON technology that combines sensors and AI to be able to perform a series of continuous rallies. However, when playing with the world's top ping-pong players, the spins of the balls that it produces also change by a digit. So in the end, could you return its attacks?

FORPHEUS senses the other player's movements as well as the position of the ball using three cameras installed directly above the table. It predicts the trajectory of the ball, and accurately and precisely moves its racket to return the ball. Given that the theme is "The Harmony of Man and Machine," the goal isn't to win against the human, but to become a training partner, so that the human could further improve.

This latest 9th generation Robopong was unveiled at the Tokyo Big Sight during "Semicon Japan," the semi-conductor industry's largest local exhibit. It's been installed with Gen-AI, and can therefore talk with the player while doing the training.

Ms. HARIMOTO says that she had seen a video of FORPHEUS beforehand, and as they did the rallies, "It's quite a formidable ping-pong player. I can feel my adrenaline rising."

At the start, the pace was slow-going, and both rallied with no difficulty whatsoever. When FORPHEUS said, "I see that my partner is an experienced ping-pong player," the audience laughed. "Let's make this a tad faster, OK," sending a fast ball to his partner. Finally, Ms. HARIMOTO decided to make a powerful smash that even the Robopong could not catch it. 

Ms. HARIMOTO says, "Really, I'd say in one word: Incredible. I thought that it's an amazing piece of technology that didn't make mistakes and could play at a stable pace. I also felt that I had to pick up my pace to return the ball. It made me catch my breath a little."

While the OMRON product makes a strong impression that it's linked to health with its body temperature and weight measuring capabilities, it's a top earner as far as industrial machines that streamline factory production go. Appealing for its remarkable technological capabilities, its development started around 2012.

In the beginning, the company worked on other projects, besides this one for table tennis. Examples of which include an autonomous robot and a vortex which they researched to be able to group together sardines. However, when they showcased these three projects during the event, the one that got the most positive reaction was the Robopong to which they later concentrated their efforts. While the Robopong debuted in the exhibit, they thought that maybe the best place for it is the ping-pong area.

So they grouped together a team of young engineers, and launched improved versions of the product at a pace of once every one or two years. Every year, they begin discussions with whether or not "it's really OK to develop technology for use in ping-pong." After looking at other available fields to work on, putting in factors such as exhibit space and degree of technological advancement into consideration, as well as asking whether or not there is audience engagement in the project, in the end, the decision they came up with was to do this project. 

The rallies that the Robong can do move faster every year, and this 9th generation Robopong can now handle for the first time under-spins. By calculating the ball's trajectory and the time it takes to return the ball, it can create a counter-spin that affects the ball's rotation. This time, Ms. HARIMOTO advises, "If it can create a tougher spin, it'll be so much stronger." The representative from OMRON responded, "Thank you for the encouragement," promising to work on the 10th generation.
