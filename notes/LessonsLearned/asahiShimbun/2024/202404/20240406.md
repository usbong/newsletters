> 米メタは5日、AI（人工知能）でつくられた動画や画像、音声に「Made with AI（AIで作成）」と表示すると発表した。運営するフェイスブック（FB）やインスタグラムなどで5月に導入する。今秋に米大統領選挙を控え、偽動画などの拡散を防ぐねらいがある。

Meta of America has announced this April 5th that it's putting a "Made with AI" label on AI-generated content such as videos, photographs and voice. FB and Instagram are introducing this update in May, aiming to prevent the spread of fake videos as the U.S. presidential elections draw near this coming Autumn.

>　メタはこれまで、実際に言っていないことを言ったかのように改変された動画を削除してきた。だが、昨年5月にバイデン米大統領が孫娘の胸を触っているように加工した動画がFBに投稿された際には、自社の指針に反していないと判断。この動画を削除しなかった。

Meta has up until now removed videos edited to make it appear that someone has said something which he actually didn't. However, in May of the previous year when an edited video was posted on FB showing U.S. President BIDEN touching his granddaughter's bosom, the company did not judge it to be against company policies, and did not delete the video. 

>　今年2月、外部の有識者らでつくる監督委員会がメタの指針について「（削除対象が）あまりにも限定的だ」と指摘。「2024年に（世界で）記録的な数の選挙が予定されている点を踏まえると、早急に改訂する必要がある」としていた。

Regarding Meta's policies, in February of this year, the committee of supervisors composed of experts outside the company pointed out that "Meta's scope in its removal policy is too limited." Therefore, "revisions are necessary immediately as the country approaches the coming elections, forecasted to have world record numbers of voters this 2024."

At the time when the policy was created in 2020, Meta had "mainly considered movies, because AI-generated content that look exactly like the original are rare." However, they've since made it clear that "they now agree with the committee's insistence on the narrowness of its scope." With rapid advancements in technology these past four years, they've now included photographs and voice.


On the other hand, there's apprehension that uniformly removing movies and such content made by AI will restrict freedom of expression. While the company already deletes content that show things like violence regardless of whether or not they were generated using AI, it has decided that for the rest of the content on the platform, they're putting a label on those that have been generated using AI.
