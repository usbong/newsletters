> 10月に「東京科学大」に統合する東京医科歯科大の田中雄二郎学長と東京工業大の益一哉学長が25日、朝日新聞のインタビューに応じた。世界最先端の研究をめざす上で「異分野融合は必須」と強調。将来は1人で医歯系と理工系の両方の学位を取得できる課程をつくることも検討するなど「不連続な変化に挑戦する」と語った。

Newly unified in October, the Tokyo University of Science's two university presidents, namely TANAKA, Yujiro of Tokyo Medical and Dental University and EKI, Kazuya of Tokyo Institute of Technology responded on the 25th to a request for an interview by the Asahi Shimbun. Aiming to be at the forefront of global research, they emphasized: "It's necessary to combine different fields." They added that "To tackle the challenge of discontinuous change," they're looking into creating courses for a person to be able to obtain academic units from both the School of Medicine and Dentistry and the School of Science and Engineering in the future.


>　科学大は米マサチューセッツ工科大（MIT）や英インペリアル・カレッジ・ロンドンなど世界最高峰の理系大学を目標とする。医歯系や理工系に加え、情報学や人文社会科学を融合させることで、新しい学問領域を開く「コンバージェンス・サイエンス」の実現をめざしている。

The objective of the Tokyo University of Science is to be the global top among science universities such as the Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT) from the U.S. and the Imperial College London from the U.K. Aiming to transform this idea into reality, they're opening a new academic field, "Convergence Science", which combines Information Science with the School of Humanities and Social Sciences, as well as the School of Medicine and Dentistry and the School of Science and Engineering. 

>　益学長は「最先端の研究では異分野を融合することが必須だ。多様な考えを持った研究者が集まることが、一番確実にイノベーションを起こすことにつながる。東工大、医科歯科大のトップ研究者が集まる場を設ければセレンディピティー（予想外の発見）が出ないわけがない」と話した。

"It's necessary to combine different fields when doing advanced research. Gathering researchers with diverse forms of thinking is definitely the best way to innovate. By creating a space that brings together top researchers from the Tokyo Institute of Technology and the Tokyo Medical and Dental University, serendipity (discovering something outside the expected) is bound to occur."

Already, both universities are said to be riding on 37 research ideas, which include technology that measures eye movement to understand mental health. 

They're also looking into introducing new exams and courses in the future. 

University President TANAKA made clear the reasoning behind this, "I think that this would make it possible to learn early the intersection between the School of Medicine and Dentistry and the School of Science and Engineering at the graduate level. It would take time, but I'm also considering a way for one person to obtain academic degrees from both schools."

The Tokyo Institute of Technology has added the "female group" in the selection of choices which include the comprehensive type and the school recommendations type for entrance exam takers this Spring. The university said that there were 4.6 times more applicants for the 58 total people that the four departments were recruiting.

University President EKI further promoted: "The excellent students we've been able to gather make me feel glad to have received the support from the community."

Universities like Kyoto University and Osaka University have continued to announce the establishment of a female group quota, "The same with combining two universities, we recognized the importance of tackling the problem of discontinuous change. It's not about conforming to change; rather, what we're aiming is for universities to create change."

The new top science university is expected to be decided during mid-June. Other than the two university presidents, the Tokyo Institute of Technology's Research and Innovation Director OHTAKE, Naoto was chosen to be a qualified representative. (MASUTANI, Fumio, TAKENOUCHI, Takahiro)
