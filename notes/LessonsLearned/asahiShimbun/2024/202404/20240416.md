> 2120年の日本は、人口が江戸時代レベルまで減り、都市は激減し、栄えるのは東京と福岡だけになる――。経済学者の森知也・京都大教授らのシミュレーションが注目されている。統計予測モデルから導かれる100年後の日本社会の姿はどんなものか。いま未来に向けて何をすべきなのか。

Q: By 2120, Japan's population count will have gone down to numbers described during the Edo Period. Cities would be dramatically reduced, and only Tokyo and Fukuoka will flourish. Economist MORI, Tomoya, along with professors from Kyoto University, has gotten attention for their simulation of the future. Guided by an aggregated model for making predictions, what does it say about Japanese society after 100 years? And what must be done now as we approach that future? 

>　――100年後の日本では、人口10万人以上の都市の数が半減する。多くの地方都市が消え、大都市で人口シェアを増加させるのは東京と福岡だけ、というのは衝撃的な予測ですね。

Q: 100 years from now, the number of cities with over 100,000 residents in Japan will have been reduced by half. Many of the cities region-wide will have disappeared, and only large cities, particularly, Tokyo and Fukuoka will have an increased share of the population. This is their shocking prediction.

>　「都市が消滅する理由は単純で、日本全体の人口が減るからです。人口減少はすごい勢いで進むが、日本ではどこかひとごとのようなところがある。一つの理由は、規模感がわからないということがあると思います」

A: "The reason why cities will disappear is simple. It's because the Japanese population as a whole is decreasing. Yet while this reduction in the population is still moving along rather strongly, there are places in Japan where human activities are quite concentrated. I think that one reason for this is that people don't have a sense of scale.

>　――総人口は、5千万人から3千万人ぐらいまでに減るという想定ですね。

Q: The total population is estimated to be reduced to about 30 to 50 million.

>　「人口戦略会議では8千万人で食い止めようと様々な提案をしていますが、今の人口減少ペースでは難しそうです。江戸時代と同じ3千万人台に減るというのが現実的な想定なのですが、行政も国民も危機感が足りません」

A: "At a meeting on strategic population planning, there were all sorts of proposals to stop it at 80 million. This looks hard from the current rate of decrease in the population. While it's realistic to think that the population will be reduced to 30 million, just as during the Edo Period, there's not enough sense of crisis on the part of both the administration and the local people."

Q: What about Nagoya?

A: "Due to its varied historical context, Nagoya is special for having an extremely strong manufacturing industry nearby. Even at this current stage, while the barrier in distance to reach Nagoya from Tokyo is lower than Osaka, it will not go into a decline like Osaka. Instead, through highly progressive city planning which includes 100-meter roads, it's likely going to continue on to be a city that can easily adapt to future technologies in fields like the automobile industry."

A: "While people in many areas will decrease, even a few people can make use of technology to create infrastructures to earn in primary industries like agriculture, forestry and fisheries, because they're blessed with an abundance of natural resources. The tourism industry will likely be third in rank for businesses. And places like the San'in region and Kochi prefecture will grow despite being separated from railway tracks and the main highways."

"However, because of that, it will be necessary to have a base point for distribution in various places to support primary industries. Because it's not possible to maintain all the existing cities, it'll likely be necessary to also have a "selection and concentration" plan to identify which infrastructures to invest in and which cities will become the base points."
