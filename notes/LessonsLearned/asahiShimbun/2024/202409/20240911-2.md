> 東京大学が、来年度入学者から学部の授業料を現在よりも約11万円値上げし、64万2960円にする方針を明らかにした。企業などとの共同研究や寄付などで収入を増やしてきたにもかかわらず、なぜ学生に痛みを伴う値上げに踏み切るのか。

The University of Tokyo has announced its new 642,960 yen (about 321,480 Philippine pesos) school fee policy which increases course fees by about 110,000 yen (about 55,000 Philippine pesos) starting next school year. Despite the increase in university funding through donations and research partnerships with businesses, what is the reason for this increase that causes so much hardship among students?

> 東大の藤井輝夫総長らが、幹部教員らに授業料の値上げ案を最初に示したのは5月14日。翌日に各社が報道すると、すぐに学生たちから反発の声があがった。

University President, FUJII, Teruo says that it was in May 14 when he first showed the plan to increase the course fees to the university's top faculty. The next day, when various news agencies reported this, protests immediately broke out from among the students. 

>　同19日に文京区の本郷キャンパスで開かれた学園祭「五月祭」では、30人ほどの学生が抗議デモを実施。「東大生が全員、恵まれているわけではない」「東大が値上げすれば他大学にも広がってしまう」などと撤回を訴えた。経済的に厳しい学生の声などを集めたフリーペーパーを配ったり、安田講堂前にテントを張って反対を訴えたりするグループも現れた。教員の一部も反対を表明した。

On the 19th, during the "May School Festival" at the home campus in Bunkyo district, as much as 30 students came out to protest. They complained, "Not all University of Tokyo students have been fortunate.", "If fees increase at the University of Tokyo, this will also spread to other universities." There was also a group who put up a tent in front of Yasuda Lecture Hall as protest, giving pieces of paper that contained messages from the financially stricken students. It was found out that there was also a part of the faculty who protested.

>　こうした動きを受け、藤井総長は6月下旬、オンラインで学生に対し、値上げ案とともに財務状況の厳しさも説明し、理解を求めた。それでも学生らの反発は収まらず、幹部らは再検討を開始。7月中旬に25年度の入学者選抜要項と同時に発表する予定を、「学内で丁寧にコミュニケーションのプロセスを踏んでいる」として延期していた。

Due to this protest, University President FUJII, Teruo met with the students online at the latter part of June and explained the university's financial situation and the plan to increase the fees, seeking their understanding. However, he was unable to put the protests under control, which initiated the re-evaluation of the policy by top faculty members. Plans to announce the selection of new and incoming students for 2025 were postponed to mid-July to make way for "Beginning the process of polite communication inside the university."

>　東大は値上げの理由として、教職員の人件費や教育関連に使われている運営費交付金の減額を挙げる。国からの配分額は約20年で80億円近く減り、23年度は847億円だった。このため産学連携や寄付金の獲得などに力を入れ、収入を増やしてきた。

The increase in the course fees at the University of Tokyo has led to the reduction in the amount of money alloted for operational expenses that are used for faculty and education-related activities. By around 2020, the total money distributed nationwide was reduced by close to 8 billion yen (about 4 billion Philippine pesos), and was at 84.7 billion yen (about 42.3 billion Philippine pesos) in 2023. Because of this, they've made efforts to increase university income through donations and by creating industry-partnerships.

## ADDITIONAL NOTES

Behind the increase in the course fees is the reality that there are plenty of University of Tokyo students who were born from affluent households. According to a study done by the university in 2021, 54% of students answered that their annual household income is "over 9.5 million yen (about 4.75 million Philippine pesos)." There were plenty who sent their children to review schools to prepare for middle school exams and to private schools that integrated both middle-high school levels. This limits the impact of the price increase.

Still, 14% of students are from households that earn less than 4.5 million yen (about 2.25 million Philippine pesos) per year. If they have a sibling, making ends meet would be difficult even with a decent annual income. The protesters which included students and teachers, among others, complained, "There are people who won't be able to go to the University of Tokyo due to the fee increase."
