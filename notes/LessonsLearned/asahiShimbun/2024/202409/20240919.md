> ウイルスをやっつける免疫細胞が、自分の組織を攻撃して自己免疫病を起こすのはなぜか。大阪大の荒瀬尚教授らのグループが、自己と非自己のほか、「異物をもつ自己」を認識して攻撃する仕組みがあることを見つけ、米専門誌に発表した。新たな治療法開発につながる可能性がある。

Why would the cells that attack viruses attack the immune system, hence creating the disorder? The team of Prof. ARASE, Takashi from Osaka University has published in a U.S. specialist magazine that they've found the mechanism that recognizes, in addition to whether a cell is its own or not, whether "a cell itself has abnormality." This can be said to be tied to the development of new medical treatment. 

>　ウイルスが感染した細胞などを非自己と認識して攻撃し、自己の細胞は攻撃しないことは免疫の基本概念だ。免疫の司令塔であるT細胞が、細胞の表面に提示された目印を使って、自己と非自己を見分けている。たとえばウイルスが感染した細胞では、ウイルス由来のたんぱく質の断片である「ペプチド」が特定の分子とくっついて提示される。

It's a fundamental concept of the immune system to be able to recognize and not attack one's own cells, while only attacking those that have been infected by a virus and are not its own. T-cells, the immune system's Command Posts, use signals that are shown on its surface, and can differentiate whether a cell is its own or not. For example, cells, which have been infected by a virus, show that "peptide", a part of a protein from the virus, would stick to specific atoms.

The team has continued with the research work, and has found a case where the cells would show on its surface not the peptide, but its own abnormal protein, which they named, "Neoself."

>　ネオセルフの細胞をもつマウスを作って解析すると臓器のはれ、発熱など、全身エリテマトーデス（SLE）という自己免疫病の症状が出た。この症状はネオセルフ自体ではなく、ネオセルフを異物として認識し攻撃するT細胞があることで引き起こされることもわかった。

After producing a mouse which has the Neoself cells and analyzing it, they found that its internal organs were swelling, had an onset of fever, and later the immune system disorder called "Systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE)." They also learned that this disorder is not itself caused by Neoself cells alone, but is brought about by the presence of T-cells which recognize and attack abnormal Neoself cells.

They also confirmed that an SLE patient has plenty of these T-cells that recognize Neoself cells. It was also found out that an SLE patient has a high frequency of revitalizing herpes, a type of virus. When this virus is revitalized, it was learned that it becomes easier to produce Neoself cells.

"This can be tied to the development of new medical treatment and in explaining the mechanism of various immune system disorders like rheumatoid arthritis, type-1 diabetes, etc."

The paper was published on the 14th in the U.S. Science Magazine Cell (https://doi.org/10.1016/j.cell.2024.08.025; last accessed: 20240920). (SEGAWA, Shigeko)
