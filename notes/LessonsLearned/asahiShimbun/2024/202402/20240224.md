>　米株式市場で22日、米半導体大手エヌビディアの株価が急騰した。同社が前日発表した好決算を受け、日本や欧州で主要株価が最高値をつけたほか、主要企業でつくるダウ工業株平均が初めて終値で3万9千ドルを超えるなど、影響は世界の主要市場に広がった。

The stock value of large U.S. semi-conductor corporation NVIDIA soared rapidly at the U.S. stock exchange on the 22nd. The company announced the previous day that it has received favorable financial ratings, receiving not only the highest value for its primary stocks in places like Japan and Europe, but also its final stock value on the Dow Jones Industry average surpassed for the first time 39,000 USD. The impact spread to the main global marketplace.

>　エヌビディアの株価は22日、前日比約16%上昇。ロイター通信によると、同社の時価総額は1・9兆ドル（約285兆円）を超え、1日で約2770億ドル（約42兆円）増えた。米企業の時価総額の1日の増加額としては過去最大という。

NVIDIA's stock value on the 22nd rose by about 16% as compared to the previous day. According to Reuters News, the corporation's total value surpassed 1.9 trillion USD (about 285 trillion yen), increasing by about 277 billion USD (about 42 trillion yen) in 1 day. This is reported to be the American business' largest increase in stock value in 1 day in record history.

### USBONG NOTE

1) High stock value reported to have been due to the boom in Artificial Intelligence (AI) causing the need for more semi-conductors, among others, in the tech industry. 

2) Digital payments have also increased globally; no trust in financial institutions such as the local bank? Telecom corporations also want to take hold of the market via mobile payments, e.g. GCASH.
