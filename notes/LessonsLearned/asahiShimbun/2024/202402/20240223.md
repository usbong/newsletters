>　洋画の幕開けといえば、思い浮かぶシーンがある。ライオンが咆哮（ほうこう）したり、地球がぐるりと回ったり。米映画会社の「顔」である。トーチを掲げた女性もその一つだ▼

There's a scene that comes to mind when we speak about film openings in Western flicks. A lion roars, and the globe rotates. It's the "face" of the American motion picture company. Another one of these is the woman who carries a torch.

> ▼彼女が和服を着てニューズウィーク誌の表紙に登場したことがある。１９８９年、コロンビア・ピクチャーズをソニーが買収した時だ。記事は「米国の魂を日本企業が買った」。

▼In fact, she has appeared on the front page of Newsweek magazine while wearing a Japanese dress. This was in 1989 when Columbia Pictures was purchased by Sony. The article wrote, "A Japanese business has bought the American soul." 

### USBONG NOTE

1) Immediately after, Mitsubishi Estate bought the Rockefeller group. How far the power of Japanese money could go was yet to be known. This was when the average Nikkei stock price was historically at its highest by the end of the year. 

However, during this time, the stock price in other countries like America and Germany was going 10 times higher. If we think about it, this was when the personal computer, much less the mobile phone, was yet to be widely used. Unlike the Bubble era, the business conditions at the time were much more terrible. 

100 yen shops that sold cheapness were constantly flourishing, and just before the last train arrived in Ginza, Tokyo, everyone began to return home a little earlier. This means that people moved slowly when it came to spending. But as to whether or not this is linked to genuine growth, the outcome is more evident moving forward.


2) value in variation of words; bought, purchased

3) from hereon; henceforth
