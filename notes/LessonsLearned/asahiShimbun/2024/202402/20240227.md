>　店長の渡辺翔さんは「高額化しているのは、主にプレーヤー数が少ない時代に販売されたカード。販売枚数が少ないため、コレクションや投資目的で売買されます」と明かす。

The store owner, Mr WATANABE, Sho explains, "The cards whose price is going up are those that were sold mainly during the time when there weren't a lot of players. Because there weren't a lot of cards that had been sold, these are now bought by people who want to make them a part of their collection, investment, and so on."

## USBONG NOTES

1) Mr FUJII, Daisuke, Editor-in-Chief of the toy specialists magazine, "The Monthly Toy Genre", points out, "When the generation who played the card game during their youth has gotten older, a large portion of them return to the game. More and more older people buy cards at a much higher price, and they even recommend the game to their own children."

Due to the CORONA, there was an increase in opportunity for people to stay at home, and parents playing card games with their own children for amusement have impacted the growth of the market.

The three top sellers have been "Pokémon (1996)", "Yu-Gi-Oh (1999)", and "Duel Masters (2002)".

2) From the CCTV Camera, two people pried open the shutters during the early morning, entered the store, and broke the glass case where the cards were lined up inside. The camera showed that they were stealing the cards for several hours. 

The total loss for the cards alone was valued to about 25 million yen. Over 800 cards were stolen.

In the Akihabara electronics district alone, there has been several cases of this type of theft occurring in several card specialty stores since November of the previous year.
