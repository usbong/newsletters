>　日中韓首脳会談（サミット）が27日午前、4年半ぶりに開催されます。中国側は今回の会談にどのような狙いをもって臨むのでしょうか。日中関係改善のカギはどこにあるでしょうか。中国・上海の復旦大学日本研究センターの胡令遠教授に聞きました。

The Japan-China-Korea summit was held in the morning of the 27th, four years after the last meeting. What sort of objective does the side of China have for this year's summit? Where could the key to improving Japan-China relations be? We ask Professor HU, Lingyuan of the Japanese Research Center of Fudan University in Shanghai, China.

>　中日韓首脳会談の従来のテーマは、政治外交ではなく主に経済や貿易の協力だった。中日、中韓そして中日韓にとって経済面での協力関係は、船を安定させるバラスト（重し）だった。だがこの数年で急速な変化が起きた。それは、経済安全保障という考え方によって、供給網などの経済的な要素が政治化されたことだ。

The theme of the China-Japan-Korea summit is not political diplomacy, but mainly economic and trade cooperation. Economically speaking, for China-Japan, China-Korea and China-Japan-Korea, cooperation means the ballast (weight) that stabilizes ships. However, these past several years, there has been a rapid change, that is, the politicization of economic factors like supply-chain distribution caused by the "economic safety and security" way of thinking. 

>　３カ国の関係はこれにより大きな影響を受けている。今回のサミットも経済が主たるテーマにはなると思うが、最低限のコミュニケーションしかできないだろう。経済安保が3カ国に与える影響などについて意見交換をするかもしれない。

This has made a huge impact in the relationship of the three nations. While I think that economics is also a main theme in the summit, we could only really have a minimum level of communication. Perhaps, "economic safety and security" simply means the exchange of ideas regarding its impact to the three nations.  

>　中日関係をふり返ると、2019年の中日韓首脳会談のころ、関係は理想的な方向に向かっていた。習近平（シーチンピン）国家主席が国賓として訪日を控え、中国から日本への観光客も1千万人近かった。

If we reflect on China-Japan relations, during the China-Japan-Korea Summit in 2019, talks had moved towards the ideal direction. When President XI, Jinping's visit to Japan drew near, tourists coming from China to Japan reached 10 million.

The change after four and a half years, and the problem with Taiwan

## MORE

However, in four and a half years, there has been a change in the national sentiment. Maritime problems have occurred, and the mutual degree of goodwill among the nations has lowered. Pulled by the conflict between Russia and Ukraine, Prime Minister KISHIDA, Fumio has indicated the possibility of conflict even in the Taiwan Strait. Moreover, China has to confront  the great challenge brought about by the deepening of the alliance between the US and Japan-Korea. 

Furthermore, on the 20th, China has given a lot of attention to the newly elected Taiwanese President LAI, Qingde and on Japan-Taiwan relations. In actuality, for the longest time, China-Japan relations have been a thorn to Japan-Taiwan relations. While Mr. LAI ate lunch together with the Japanese parliament during the ceremony, it was intentionally done for the sake of appearances. For Taiwan to become independent, its relationship with Japan has to be strengthened, and its economic relations with Japan must deepen even while nothing is said about independence and facade.

In improving China-Japan relations, the Taiwan problem is considered to be an extremely broad issue, and is a difficult and dangerous problem. Japan must be prudent with its relations with Taiwan, and must control its excessive exchanges with Taiwan on fields other than economics and culture. Along with the US, it's necessary to mutually move calmly and logically in reexamining the red line that none must cross.

The key to improving China-Japan relations is communication. Economic cooperation like Free Trade Agreements (FTA) can be mutually beneficial. The summit among the three nations is important as a way for talks between China and Japan to continue. (Reporter: INOUE, Ryo)
