> 日本は武器輸出大国へと変貌（へんぼう）を遂げようとしているのでしょうか。経済学者として武器移転の歴史を研究してきた東大名誉教授の小野塚知二さんは日本の限界を指摘しつつ、「武器を外国に売らない」ことこそ、大切な倫理的価値なのだと語っています。

Would Japan turn into a giant doing weapons exporting? For economist and renowned Tokyo University professor, Mr. ONO, who's done research work on the history of weapons armaments transfer, points to Japan's limits, "will not sell weapons abroad", says that it's a invaluable logical value.

> ――日本が武器を輸出できる「普通の国」になるのは、「愚者の選択」だと指摘してきましたね。なぜ愚かだと思うのですか。

For Japan to become a "common nation" that can export weapons, you've pointed out that it's "a fool's decision", right? Why do you think that it's foolish?

>　「そもそも日本にとって望ましいのは、国民の消費が伸びて発展するという消費主導型の経済です。ところが、武器輸出は投資主導型で、国が投資し続け、赤字国債が増えて、一部の兵器企業だけがうるおう。健全な経済とは言えません」

"First and foremost, what Japan hopes is an economy guided by consumption developing via increasing people consumption. However, because weapons exporting is guided investments, the nation continues to invest, the national deficit increases, only a part of the weapons business can sell. This cannot be said to be sound economics."

>　「さらにいえば、抑止力が成り立つのは相手次第です。抑止力とは、相手がこちら側の力を恐れるか否かに依存しており、こちら側で一方的に決めることはできないのです。日本が軍備を増強し、さらに日本製の武器を輸入する国が増えたところで、中国や北朝鮮、ロシアが態度を変えるでしょうか。むしろ硬化して、安全保障環境が悪化するはずです」

"Furthermore, establishing control depends on the partner. Regulating power, the partner is afraid or not of our power exists, we cannot decide one way. Japan increases military equipment, further Japan-made weapons exporting countries have increased, China, North Korea and Russia could change their stance. Instead, solidifying, safety environment should worsen."

>　――武器移転の歴史を研究してきて、そう思うわけですね。

Researching on history of weapons transfer, that's how you'd think.

>　「歴史的にみると、武器移転は金銭的対価を伴わず、貸与・無償供与という形をとることが多いことに気づきます」

"Looking at this historically, weapons transfer does not go with monetary value, I noticed that many forms of lending and donation supplying."

Why is this?

"It's for the partner country to be under it's control. Once weapons are taken, training for the soldiers that use that weapon, repair and replenishments, and cannot anymore cut the tie. Because of this, at the start, even if it's lent, a full business will be established. Weapons transfer also has that aspect."

Q: Peace can be protected using weapons.

"Needless to say, weapons are tools whose purpose is to destroy and kill. When that method spreads, I think that it's natural to think that the danger of war also rises. Originally, the objective and strategy of the nation, it's for that that the method would be chosen, in actuality, depending only on military weapons is the failure of diplomacy."


Q: Weapons spread ends is regulated.


"For example, what I feel is the gun danger in US society is that gun regulations are mild. Japan whose rules are strict, such is unthinkable. Even the military, if weapons spread, danger increases, peace conditions are lost. Therefore, weapons transfer is as much as possible should be none. It's simple reason, but fundamental."


Q: "military affairs and diplomacy go together" are said.

"If Japanese diplomacy does that, it's a tragedy. Without relying on military, how can war be evaded using discussion, culture, people diplomacy, and maintain peace? Thinking about that, is diplomacy. From the start, depending only on military, I think is the failure of diplomacy."


"Around Japan, unfortunately, soldier's life politically, social cost is lowered, human rights, democracy too freedom of expression regulated nation. A country who has difficulty military and government responsibility for soldier loss, can throw soldiers lives. This type of partner should first presume to say "We don't go to war." In this case, increasing regulatory power, thinking of establishing safety and security, what is learned? It's only to say that local is strong.


"Troy's wooden horse" to infiltrate the US?


Q: Do you think Japan will be a big weapons exporter country?


"I don't think so. Weapons exporting is Japan's weakest area. After the war, Japan did not have experience exporting weapons, did training sessions, repair and replenishments, and didn't have the trust of other nations. It's an illusion to think that "equal partner" even with jointly developing next generation fighter jts with Japan, English and Italy."


"America also exists. If good technology can come out of the development of next generation fighter jets, America would likely intervene. The US put pressure on Japan "to bring out the technology." Looking at England and ITaly, Japan is only going to be the likely the so-called "Trojan Horse" of US intervention." 

Q: While England and Italy also have relations with the US, what could be the difference?

"They're already big weapons export countries, have established the NATO, and facing up to US Influence. Even looking at territorial cooperation with the US, they're much more independent than Japan."

"Japan is independent from America, and developing and producing weapons and becoming a big weapons exporting country is a delusion. Under the protection of the US, that would not be allowable."

Q: The problem with weapons exporting is that it's also tied with Japan being a country that has them.


"To say the truth, in this coming discussion, from the global knowledge, it's starting to move away. Military affairs is all weapons, regardless of whether it has the ability to kill and harm, being able to export is common knowledge."

"But that is having a discussion in that itself, shows that this problem is important for Japan. "We do not sell weapons to foreign countries" is becoming to have an important logical value. That is in the 9th section of the constitution is set as a fundamental universal ideal. In weapons exporting, the value of peaceful nations is harmed, and if it's like throw-away cloth for cleaning, it gives negative impact to Japan's security. If that's so, it's not a matter that is decided with the cabinet, it's perhaps at least necessary to thoroughly deliberate it in the Diet." (Reporter: KOMURATA, Yoshiyuki)
