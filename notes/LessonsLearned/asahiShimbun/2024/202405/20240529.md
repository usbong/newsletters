> スクウェア・エニックス・ホールディングス（HD）は3日、松田洋祐社長（59）が退任し、桐生隆司取締役（47）が社長に昇格する人事を発表した。社長交代は2013年以来、10年ぶり。6月に開く予定の定時株主総会で正式に決める。娯楽の多様化によってゲーム市場の競争は激しい。経営体制の若返りで生き残りを図る。

Square-Enix Holdings (HD) announced on the 3rd of March the retirement of CEO MATSUDA, Yosuke (59), and the rise of board member KIRYU, Takashi (47) to the CEO position. It has been 10 years since the company CEO was last changed in 2013. The decision will be formally made during the regular shareholders meeting set in May. Diversification in the entertainment industry has brought about fierce competition to capture the video games market, where survival is deemed to be hinged upon putting younger people into management roles.

Mr. KIRYU entered the giant advertising company DENTSU in 1998 and was put in-charge of marketing. In June of 2020 when he came to Square-Enix Holdings (HD), he assisted Mr. MATSUDA and was one of the people highly responsible for business strategy. During a meeting with reporters in the metropolis, Mr. KIRYU says, "With regard to Square-Enix, I've had a huge fondness for the company since my early childhood," making clear his "love of games."

Mr. KIRYU was born in 1975, and shares that when the first "Dragon Quest" game was sold in 1986 and the first "Final Fantasy" game in 1987, "I bought all of them on the first day of their release." Furthermore, he says, "Quite interestingly and while a bit geeky, I also bought the formerly known SquareSoft's 'Tobal No.1" masterpiece (released in 1996), which he found impressive for taking up the challenge to innovate.


The current video games market is facing fierce competition due to other content media like music and video distribution that are also stealing users' time. The future has become uncertain. Mr. KIRYU says, "We return to the starting point where we ask ourselves what kind of product does a certain customer want. I want to change the development process to increase efficiency and profitability."  


The present CEO Mr. MATSUDA attended the meeting, noting that with regard to Mr. KIRYU, "He is the type of person who accomplishes tasks up until the end. In a time of great change, such fundamental quality is important." When asked about himself, he says, "I'm thinking that for the coming 10, 20 years onward, I'll be passing on the baton," sharing his thoughts about retiring from the company.
