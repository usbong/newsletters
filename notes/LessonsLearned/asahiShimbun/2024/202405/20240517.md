The team at Osaka University has confirmed that bacteria in the medicine called "Probiotics" could, after entering the blood, cause the "Bacteremia (bacteria in the blood) disease." They want medical doctors to consider writing prescriptions appropriate for patients whose immune systems have long since weakened accordingly.

>　プロバイオティクス製剤は細菌の働きなどによって、整腸や抗生物質による下痢の予防などさまざまな効果が報告され、広く使われている。

Probiotics continue to be widely used. Based on reports on the activities of the bacteria, the effects of using Probiotics include prevention of diarrhea due to its capability to assist the intestines and its use of antibiotics.  

>　グループは、2022年、発熱などの症状から菌血症を疑った入院中の患者の血液を培養して、クロストリジウム・ブチリカムという細菌を見つけた。この細菌は、患者が処方されていたプロバイオティクス製剤の成分だが、環境中にも存在するため、製剤が菌血症の原因かどうかはわからなかった。

In 2022, the team cultured the blood of patients who had been admitted in the hospital and who were suspected of having the Bacteremia disease after the onset of fever and such symptoms. What they found was that the bacteria called "Clostridium butyricum" was present in patients' blood. This bacteria is a component of the Probiotics prescribed to patients, and also exists in the environment, but was not known at the time whether it caused Bacteremia.

The team investigated the database of patients who had Bacteremia while hospitalized at the affiliate Hospital of the Osaka University Medical School from 2011 to 2023. In the blood culture of 6576 people whom bacteria was detected, they found five who had this type of bacteria. All had been prescribed Probiotics. 

Analyzing the bacteria genome detected from the blood of the five patients, and after comparing this with the bacteria of the Probiotics, they found that there was little difference between the two, such that it's now presumed that the bacteria originally came from the Probiotics and had gone into the patients' blood. The patients were admitted in the hospital for diseases like Cancer and kidney problems, and whose immune systems were failing.

Associate Prof. SADA, Ryuichi says on behalf of their team, "A variety of effects result from using Probiotics. We learned, however, that the rare Bacteremia can be found in patients whose immunity system is failing while admitted in the hospital. What we want is to avoid unnecessary prescriptions, whatever medicine it may be."
