> 「我々の活動は理解されにくいが、真実を浮き彫りにするため、あえて真逆（まぎゃく）の立場から意見を申し上げる。そのために今日ここに立っている」

"While our actions are difficult to understand, our goal has been to explicitly bring out the truth. Therefore, we shall express our opinions from a contrarian's point of view. It is because of this that we are standing here today."

>　36人が死亡した京都アニメーション放火殺人事件の裁判員裁判で7日、青葉真司被告（45）の弁護人を務める遠山大輔弁護士は最終弁論でこう訴えた。

On the 7th, during the trial concerning the arson incident where 36 people died at the animation studio in Kyoto, Atty TOYAMA, Daisuke, who's been tasked to be the lawyer of the defendant, Mr AOBA, Shinji (45), appealed in his final argument in this way.

> 青葉被告の裁判をめぐっては、多くの犠牲者が出たことなどから、弁護団に対し、「凶悪犯をなぜ弁護するのか」といった批判がネット上で相次いでいた。

Meanwhile, regarding the trial of the defendant, Mr AOBA, the many victims who've come out have continued to express their criticisms online aiming their sentiments such as "Why should the law defend a malevolent crime?" toward the association of lawyers.

>　遺族の意見陳述でも、京アニ第1スタジオの建物の構造が被害を拡大させた可能性があるとする弁護側の主張に対し、「傷ついた」と打ち明けた人がいた。法廷での弁護活動を「遺族の心情を軽視している」と疑問視する声もあった。

Even from the bereaved family's statements, there were people who had opened up to being "hurt" by the lawyers' emphasis that there exists the possibility that the harm had been enlarged due to the building structure of the Kyoto Animation Studio#1. There was also doubt towards the lawyers' actions at the trial court where it appeared that "the bereaved family's feelings were only lightly being considered."

>　遠山弁護士はこの日の最終弁論で、「遺族の処罰感情は十分にくみ取られるべきものだ」と述べた。一方で、「青葉被告に刑事責任能力は認められない」と主張していることを念頭に、「処罰感情が峻烈（しゅんれつ）だからといって、死刑にしてはいけない」と投げかけた。

Atty TOYAMA for his final argument this day said, "The bereaved family's sentiments in favor of punishment ought to be sufficiently dealt with." On the one hand, while keeping in mind his emphasis that "he could not agree that the defendant, Mr AOBA, is capable of bearing the liability for the crime," he did begin to dismiss the idea that the "defendant should be punished by death just because there is strong sense and feeling for punishment."
