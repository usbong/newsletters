I wasn’t really good with making friends, so I sought a place where I could hang-out with “YANKEE” people. To be recognized by the “YANKEE” people, I had to repeatedly do bad things, until they became professionally bad. I had been caught by the Police uncountable times.

>　カリフォルニア大学（UC）バークリー校では、先生たちが日本人留学生数人と話をする機会が設けられており、その中に鈴木さんがいた。長身で優しそうな笑みを浮かべていた鈴木さんに、新聞記者だと名乗って声をかけると「僕はほかの人のような経歴じゃないんで」と、恐縮したように言ったのを覚えている。
　鈴木さんの経歴は、全米屈指の大学の日本人留学生としては、確かに異色だった。

At the University of California-Berkeley, the teachers create opportunities for a number of Japanese international students to speak. Among them was Mr SUZUKI. Going by as a newspaper reporter, I came up to Mr SUZUKI, who was tall and had a seemingly kind smile. I remember his saying somewhat timidly, “I don’t have the same life history as that of other people…” Mr SUZUKI’s life history was certainly different, being a Japanese international student in one of the best universities of America.

He was born in KAWASAKI City. His father was a business man at an insurance company of foreign ownership, while his mother worked and did household chores perfectly. It was with that kind of family, that when he entered Middle School, he immediately became “BAD”. At the time, his parents were not in good relations with each other, and Mr SUZUKI explains that it was for that reason that their home became bad.

>　大手IT企業に勤める鈴木琢也さん（37）と初めて会ったのは9年前。日本の有名進学校の先生たちが米国のトップ大学を視察するのに同行取材した時だ。当時、受験実績がトップ級の進学校では、東大ではなく海外の大学に進学を志望する動きが広がりつつあった。

It was 9 years ago when I first met Mr SUZUKI, Takuya (37), an employee at a big IT company. It was during the time when I was gathering materials on famous preparatory schools in Japan whose teachers were focusing on TOP Universities in America. At top preparatory schools, which boast of achievements based on university acceptance, there has been a continuous increase in the promulgation of willingness to proceed to universities abroad, instead of the University of TOKYO.
