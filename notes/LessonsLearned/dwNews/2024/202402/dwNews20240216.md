> Sextorsión: cómo defenderse de los extorsionadores

## Defense against sextortionists

How do they attack? 

1. threats, e.g. shall send to followers, friends, family your nude photos, unless victims pays.
2. become friends, get information; victims shares information; (social engineering)

## Solution:
1. inform your children on the tactics of sextortionists;
2. never pay; don’t reveal intimate information;
3. speak with your children, close-relations about experiences on sextortion
