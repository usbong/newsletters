> Sextorsión: cómo defenderse de los extorsionadores

## Defense against sextortionists

How do they attack? 

1. threats, e.g. shall send to followers, friends, family your nude photos, unless victims pays.

> self analysis: starts first with attacker receiving non-nude photo/videos; then victim becomes afraid, realizes has been talking with stranger; put in ideas, e.g. illegal drugs; victim becomes even more afraid; attacker has received photo/video from victim; extortion; edits photo/video to be nude, etc;

2. become friends, get information; victims shares information; (social engineering)

## Solution:
1. inform your children on the tactics of sextortionists;
2. never pay; don’t reveal intimate information;
3. speak with your children, close-relations about experiences on sextortion
