### USBONG NOTES

"missiles and drones"<br/>
SIMULATION GAME development

1) objective: increase know-how,<br/>
--> however IF only development team,<br/>
--> COUNT shall still be noticeably small;<br/>
--> keyphrase: MATH techniques;<br/>
--> adds: IF development team members increased<br/> 
--> GAME shall NOT be PROFITABLE,<br/>
--> due to: excess members,<br/>
--> who: receive payment without noticeable contribution;

2) FROM PHILIPPINES?<br/>
--> reminder: increase in know-how<br/> 
--> causes: increase in SECURITY/DEFENSE against ATTACKS,<br/>
--> where: SECURITY/DEFENSE != CONSUMERS only,<br/>
--> albeit as PRODUCERS&CONSUMERS,<br/>
--> where: PRODUCERS part > CONSUMERS part

3) TO CONSUMERS (NORTH AMERICA?)<br/>
--> where: BATTLE, via FIGHTER instinct (not with noticeable MATH) CAN WIN;<br/>
--> remembers: [IGN JAPAN TRIANGLE STRATEGY interview](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PKuEGupRTAM),<br/> 
--> where: as recommendation, lessen players' NUMBERS THINKING in GAMEPLAY
