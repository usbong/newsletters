> Am I wrong!? On today's episode of Jankyard, I get to play through this Toy Story copy fighting game called Toy Fighter! I really enjoy how unique this fighting game is, but it DEFINITELY belongs under the "jank" category! Have you guys played this game before?   

あれっ、僕、間違ってる？今日の「ジャンクヤード」エピソードでは、Toy Story のコピー格闘ゲーム、いわゆる「Toy Fighter」をやり通すんだ。このユニークなゲームが本当に楽しかったので、絶対に「ジャンク」といカテゴリー（分類）なんだ！みんな、このゲームやったことある？
