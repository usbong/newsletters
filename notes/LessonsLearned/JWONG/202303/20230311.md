> I played against the GODFATHER of Necro, Sugiyama, over at BIG-ONE2nd CHANNEL2 in Japan. I can't believe how many times I've been robbed and stunned, but this was an extremely sweaty match. This runback set was long overdue, since I played against him years ago in the US! Hope you guys enjoy my analysis!
