> I played against the GODFATHER of Necro, Sugiyama, over at BIG-ONE2nd CHANNEL2 in Japan. I can't believe how many times I've been robbed and stunned, but this was an extremely sweaty match. This runback set was long overdue, since I played against him years ago in the US! Hope you guys enjoy my analysis!

日本で、あそこのBIG-ONE2nd CHANNEL2で、伝説の「すぎやま」と戦ったんだ。何回も盗まれたり、メマイさせられたりしたのを、自分も信じられないほど、この試合で、極端的に疲れたんだ！実はアメリカでも彼と戦ったんだけど、すでに何年間も立つので、この再検討が、だいぶ遅れたよな。って言うんだけど、おれの分析を楽しんで見てて！

### USBONG Notes

1) YOUTUBE text appeared longer during translation ACTION; "54 words" according to [LibreOffice Writer](https://www.libreoffice.org/discover/writer/);<br/>
--> observed: due to JWONGさん's used sentence pattern in English language;

> I can't believe how many times I've been robbed and stunned, but this was an extremely sweaty match. 

note: did NOT use "but"

> This runback set was long overdue, since I played against him years ago in the US! Hope you guys enjoy my analysis!

note: phrase sequence,<br/>
--> where:  put first "I played against him years ago in the US..."

頑張ろう！

2) NECRO; grab/"throw" action + parry/evade combo,<br/>
--> where: parry connects to ATTACK SUPER combo to cause STUN;<br/>
--> "offensive" parry; successful execution difficult,<br/>
--> due to: RISK of taking DAMAGE, <br/>
--> where: can quickly LOSE<br/>
--> adds: decreased opportunity to execute the combo ACTION,<br/>
--> with: increased EFFORT vis-à-vis that of another's;<br/>
--> @END OBJECTIVE? WIN,<br/>
--> albeit NECRO WINNING : ENTERTAINMENT
