### USBONG NOTES

1) sprite drawing in cover; remembers: JWONGGG to have been promoting SKULL GIRLS;

2) observed: multiple SNS accounts, e.g. twitter, classified to be video editors;<br/>
--> remembers: Mr MASAHIRO, Sakurai's recommendation of: 広報(PUBLICITY)と開発(DEVELOPMENT);<br/>
--> observed: however, video editing even in Year 2004 already doable by High School/College Students,<br/>
--> however, MONEY as profit from creating FILMS (ENTERTAINMENT) was noticeable zero/low,<br/>
--> due to: people opt to watch FREE/GRATIS, instead of PAY?<br/>
--> adds: IF FILMS INDUSTRY still @BILLION USD, there still exists sufficient number of people who DO PAY;<br/>
--> remembers: however, PLAYSTATION OUTPUT of increasing game development companies,<br/>
--> where, FAILED COMPANIES also increased;<br/>
--> examples: SEGA SATURN game development companies; in JAPAN; <br/>
--> vis-à-vis PLAYSTATION 2 game development companies; outside JAPAN, e.g. GUERRILA GAMES
