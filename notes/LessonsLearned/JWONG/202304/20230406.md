### USBONG NOTES

1. “footsies”, “neutral”… appear to be JARGON and made-up to cause variation; remembers: however, SAP tool noticeably used by American companies, e.g. in IT, Insurance fields, based in Philippines; 
2. Business Process Outsourcing (BPO), TOP Private Employer in PHILIPPINES; How to earn? via PAYPAL? expects: use of linked bank accounts with noticeable zero transfer service fees; example: use of multiple accounts of the same bank, use of multiple banks with own accounts, albeit the owner of all the accounts is the same entity (member of same family?); objective: reduce COST; 
3. remembers: [Asahi Shimbun report](https://github.com/usbong/newsletters/blob/13fb6458a6a5379dbb99d74f1c0cdaa373eea829/notes/LessonsLearned/asahiShimbun/202303/asahiShimbun20230306.md) on error at rakuten due to money transferred to spouse’s company that appeared to be a Rakuten Mobile investment; error discovered due to among others: investment already executed/being executed at another company; multiple investments using same money?
4. observed: select people may have gone with the DIGITAL/CRYPTO CURRENCY bandwagon due to forecasted problem as output of continual use of PAYPAL, where: people keep digital money into PAYPAL system; however, when time to cash-out, noticeable service fee, e.g. via foreign exchange rate; adds: however, digital payment system even in PHILIPPINES pushed, if not via PAYPAL, CRYPTO CURRENCY, et cetera
