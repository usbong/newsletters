> Decided to make a video talking about what are some things people dont realize that it happened in MVC2!  Fighting games always have these small ass details so lets talk and show them off

MVC２では、幾つかの人が気づいてなかったことを話したかったので、動画を作ることにした。格闘ゲームって、いつもこういう小さなことがあるから、見せながら、話をしょうかっと（思ってる）！

> There a few things in Marvel vs Capcom 2 competitive play that happen that may not have been explained very well (or at all, even) and I want to exhibit what they are and of course, talk about them! I also recreate a lot of these moments to show you guys how to do it. I hope you learned something today about MVC2!

Marvel vs Capcom 2には、幾つかの競争的な戦いがあってな、それと、全然、もしくはあんまり説明してくれないところあるじゃん？そういう部分を見せたくてな、あと、もちろん、話もしたいなぁと。そして、こん中にあるワザも実際にやってみて、みせてやるぞ！今日は、MVC2の何かのことを、より深く理解してくれれば、うれしい。


### FROM PHILIPPINES, SYSON, MICHAEL B.:

> カプテン・コマンドだな！あれは、確かにMVC＃1で、アシストパートナーとして、一緒に戦ったぜ！見るだけで、壁の盾、強そうじゃん！だが、JWONGさんが言ってるように、そういう壁ってワザは、速度で破れるよな。ボタンコマンドとして、複雑でない押し方だとしても、頼りすぎると、負けちゃうわけだ。

CAPTAIN COMMANDO! In MVC#1, I certainly did fought with him as my assist partner! Just looking at it, his WALL SHIELD appears STRONG! But as you say, that SHIELD tech can be broken using SPEED. Even if pressing the BUTTON COMMAND isn't complex, depending excessively on it causes DEFEAT.

> そう言えば、すでに気づいたかもしれないけど、「XMEN」、例えば「XMENvsSF」、1990年代当時あんまりやらなかったな。今JWONGさんの動画を見ても、説明してくれるけど、分かりにくいというかね。ゲームセンターで、MVC#1の結果のように、実際にやってみると、すぐ負けちゃうにちがいない。で、SFゼロ３再見すると、なんかそれに比べると、スピードとして、遅いじゃん。

Speaking of this, you may have already noticed that in the 1990's, I didn't play much "XMEN", such as "XMENvsSF" at the time. Now even viewing your VIDEO, and even with you explaning, I'd say it's difficult to understand for me. Actually playing it, I'll surely immediately LOSE at the GAME CENTER, as with the result when I played MVC#1. Viewing again SF ZERO 3, and comparing it with that, in SPEED, it's slow, huh.

> と言っても、サムライ・スピリツのほう、そういうゲームの戦いでも、勝てると良かろう。

Even saying this, it would perhaps be good if we can win using the kind of fighting in SAMURAI SPIRITS.

> 卓球のことなんだけど、年とって、ラケットを変更する選手もいるよな。つまり、体の動きが遅くなるため、スピードで選んだラケットや作戦の代わりに、テクニックにする。 ボールの回転が、どっちだとか、より多くする。

In Table Tennis, there are Athletes who change RACKETS as they age. Because the body's movement becomes slower, in exchange of choosing a racket and strategy for SPEED, they opt for TECHNIQUE. They make use of more BALL ROTATIONS, which way is it, and such.

> JWONGさんの動画に戻ると、MVC＃1って重いキャラやすぐ抜けられるキャラもいるよな。ポケットモンスターのように、そういう部分を分かりやすくすれば、自分の格闘ゲームに使えるよな。だが、それは一人じゃ、大分時間がかかる。

Returning to your VIDEO, in MVC#1, there are HEAVY characters and those that can quickly escape. As with POCKET MONSTERS, if we make that part easier to understand, we can use it in our own FIGHTING GAME. But doing that by oneself alone shall greatly need TIME.

#### NOTES: "broken" GAME parts
--> where: select characters identified to be noticeably STRONG;<br/>
--> example: STORM via rapid STRONG PUNCH to quickly increase SUPER METER;<br/>
--> keyphrase: GAME BALANCE, identified to still be NOT BALANCED after GAME RELEASE
