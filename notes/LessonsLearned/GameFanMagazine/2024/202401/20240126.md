# Notes: GameFan Magazine

text writing technique; use of multiple explicit references to other games, cartoon shows etc.

remembers: reading same person doing multiple reviews using different names

noted: 2D games receive high scores and recommendations in reviews, except if game noticeably reuses level design from earlier games in the series;
example: Megaman series
