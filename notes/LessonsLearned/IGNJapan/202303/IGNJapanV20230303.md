1) notes: IGN icon @「し」 of 「しゃべり」<br/>
--> where: icon's "X" part <br/>
--> remembers: to have observed faucet sink to have similar design, <br/>
--> where: top, bottom, left, right empty for water to sink in;<br/>
--> adds: when noticeable pool of water has formed,<br/>
--> @"X"'s center a noticeable hole appears,<br/>
--> as with whirlpool (?)
