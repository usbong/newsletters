> 『メテオス』20周年。降り積もるメテオを打ち上げて消すのがインパクト大で快感。桜井政博氏と水口哲也氏がタッグを組んだパズルゲーム【今日は何の日？】

March 10 is the 20th anniversary of "Meteos," the puzzle game that was developed as a collaboration between Mr. SAKURAI, Masahiro (Kirby series and Smash Bros. series) and Mr. MIZUGUCHI, Tetsuya (Space Channel 5 and Rez). Its fast-paced gameplay where falling "meteos" stack up and are cleared off by blasting them up and out of the screen made a huge impact among gamers.
