> 『アイスクライマー』40周年。『スマブラ』でもおなじみポポとナナを操る登山アクション。協力したりジャマをしたりふたり同時プレイが熱かった【今日は何の日？】

January 30 is the 40th anniversary of "Ice Climber," the mountain-climbing action game whose characters, Popo and Nana, have become familiar even to players of "Smash Bros." Its two-player mode where both players could play at the same time, helping or hindering one another, was a great feature.
