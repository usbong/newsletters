> ファミコン版『ツインビー』が発売された日。ふたり同時に遊べるシューティングの草分け。ポップな世界観やベルによるパワーアップ、合体攻撃が印象深い作品【今日は何の日？】

January 4 is the release day of the Family Computer version of "TwinBee," the shooting game that was the pioneer of the genre with its two-player simultaneous play and amusing power-ups like bells and things recognizable from pop culture. The joint-attack by the two ships is said to have made a strikingly profound impression.
