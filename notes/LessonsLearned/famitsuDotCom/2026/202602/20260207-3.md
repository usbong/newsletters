> 『アイスクライマー』が発売された日。『スマブラ』でもおなじみポポとナナを操る登山アクション。協力したりジャマをしたりふたり同時プレイが熱かった【今日は何の日？】

January 30 is the release day of "ICE CLIMBER," the classic NES action game where players take control of Popo and Nana, characters recognizable even in "Smash Bros.," as they make their way up the mountains. Whether playing cooperatively or creating disturbance, two players could play together simultaneously in its highly challenging multiplayer mode.
