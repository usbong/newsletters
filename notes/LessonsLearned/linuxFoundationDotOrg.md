## WHY pay for Membership Fee?
Income already > Expenses<br/>
--> due to reduced COST using Linux Operating System (OS);<br/>
<br/>
observed: reduce, reuse, recycle ACTION of machines using LINUX causes INCOME<br/>
<br/>
notes: increased use of Linux machines @workplace causes INCOME<br/>
--> adds: Microsoft OS still used by at least 1 computer/machine @workplace<br/>
--> adds: increased security due to increased need of know-how via use of combination in OS<br/>
