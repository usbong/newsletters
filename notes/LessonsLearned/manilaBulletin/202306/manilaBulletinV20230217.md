capsule's location identifies area with slow movement

results published in Nature Electronics journal

> ...sensor works by detecting a magnetic field produced by an electromagnetic coil located outside of the body.

> The strength of the magnetic field varies with distance from the coil...

> ...the sensor's position within the digestive tract can be calculated to within millimeters based on measurement of the magnetic field.

### USBONG NOTES

1) cellular telephone technology, magnets, electricity in battery, magnetic field,<br/>
--> electricity controlled via electric signals<br/>
--> due to increase in electricity consumption and heat<br/>
--> when cellular device continuously attempts to connect with wireless tower that emits weak/no signal<br/>
--> adds: mobile apps that continuously consume electricity and produce heat<br/>
--> via non-terminating, computation-heavy processes;<br/>
--> example: mobile browser opening web page using heavy 3D tech
