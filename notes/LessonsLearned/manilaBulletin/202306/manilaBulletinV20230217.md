> ...sensor works by detecting a magnetic field produced by an electromagnetic coil located outside of the body.

> The strength of the magnetic field varies with distance from the coil...

> ...the sensor's position within the digestive tract can be calculated to within millimeters based on measurement of the magnetic field.

### USBONG NOTES

1) cellular telephone technology, magnets, electricity in battery, magnetic field, electricity controlled via electric signals due to increase in electricity consumption and heat when cellular device continuously attempts to connect with wireless tower that emits weak/no signal
