### SELECT PARTS

> Antstream Arcade's claim to fame is that it offers 1,400 classic games across the Commodore 64, original PlayStation, and older Sega consoles to stream. According to the press release, several PlayStation and Nintendo classics will be available on the Xbox for the first time, though it's unknown how many first-party titles will be allowed on there.

> Also noted in the press release is that wholly new games for these classic consoles will eventually be added to the service. On Xbox, Antstream will run at $30 a year or $80 for lifetime access.
