## SELECT PARTS

> In the press release, Atari CEO Wade Rosen noted that Polymega's "approach to retro hardware is perfectly aligned" with its own goals in the retro market. "This partnership greatly expands the capabilities of the Atari VCS while also making the Polymega platform itself more compelling."

> Under the partnership, the VCS will receive Polymega support, including the latter's native app on its system. The integration will "effectively provide all of the functionality of a Polymega console to Atari VCS owners." 

> On Polymega's side, Atari-owned games will now be sold on its storefront. A cartridge module is also being developed so Atari 2600 and Atari 7800 games can be played on the system, helping to "expand the market for Atari’s line of collectible game cartridges."
