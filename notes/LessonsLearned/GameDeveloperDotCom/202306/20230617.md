ディアブロ史から七つのデザインレッスン

> Nothing lasts this long in entertainment without doing at least a few things right. And the Diablo series did a lot of things right.

エンターテインメント業界において、せめて幾つか上手くできたところをせずに、こんなに長く続けてきた作品は無い。

> The Diablo series is one of the longest-running in games, spanning a whopping 27 years that culminated in the release of Diablo IV this month. Nothing lasts that long in entertainment without doing at least a few things right. And between the addicting click-clack of its hack-and-slash combat, its gothic tones and character classes, the unending quest for rare loot and armor, plus those late-night multiplayer sessions, there’s actually a lot Diablo excelled at. Despite, or perhaps because of, its long shelf life, there are lessons we can learn from its development that are still applicable today.


ディアブロシリーズとは、２７年もかけて、一つの最も長く存在してきたゲームである。そして、今月ディアブロIVが登場。・・・

> Here are some of those lessons, compiled from developer postmortems, guides, talks and blogs from the last three decades. 

> Diablo

> The first Diablo game was released on PC on December 31, 1996, and was originally dreamed up by creator (and then high-schooler) David Brevik, who says that the series name was inspired by where he lived at the time—the base of Mt. Diablo. 

最初の「デイァブロ」ゲームは１９９６年１２月３１日にパソコンへリリースされた。当時高校生であった、ゲームクリエター、デイビッド・ブレビック氏は、ゲームとしてつくられた世界を想像し、住んでいたところ、ディアブロ山から、シリーズ名を付けられたという。...

> While it was initially conceived as a turn-based, single-player DOS claymation (!) game, the team would later take cues from the classic X-Com, copy-pasting its tiles to form the basis of Diablo’s isometric visual style, and adopting a real-time multiplayer format at Blizzard’s suggestion (a fateful, genre-defining decision they put to a studio vote, if you can believe it).

ターンベースで、シングルプレイヤーDOS粘土アニメゲームとして先に考えられたが、開発チームは、クラシックX-COMからの幾つかのアイデアを基づき、タイルのやりかたをコピー・ペーストし、ディアブロのアイソメットリックビジュアルスタイルを作成し、ブリザード社の推薦で、レアルタイムマルチプレイ形として作ることができた。

> Taking a look at how Diablo came together also gives insight into the passion and enthusiasm of the small teams that built some of the industry’s earliest games. For example, twenty years after the original Diablo’s debut, Brevik did a postmortem at GDC 2016 that gave a good look at what went right and wrong in the course of the game’s development, including how they achieved Diablo’s dynamic gothic lighting, what missteps there were in designing the game’s floorplan, how the game evolved into its real-time format, the value of the game’s simple interface and character types (in part inspired by the pacing of Doom and NHL 95, of all things) and much more. 

> Brevik also details some of the principles that guided the development of the Diablo games, outlining values that would go on to become synonymous with Blizzard’s reputation for quality. One of those is to make your game as playable as possible as soon as you can. That’s where you will “find the fun,” he says, and begin ironing out anything that hinders the player’s enjoyment.

> Because the team had a playable build “90% of the time,” they were able to test and iterate new features so quickly, rolling some out even in the weeks before the game’s release. This also allowed the devs to isolate the game’s most appealing aspect, the combat, and ensure every part of that experience, from the animations to the audio, supported a high level of stimulation (to that end, check out this relic from 2001, a Gamasutra Resource guide called Audio Content for Diablo and Diablo 2: Tools, Teams and Products, by Matt Uelmen).

> Diablo was an industry-shaker not just because of its subject matter and playstyle, but because of what it brought along with it: the online multiplayer service Battle.net, which would transform how players would connect and interact with each other for the rest of the series.

> At the time, Blizzard was understandably mum about how the system worked. In 1997, Blizzard’s Battle.net spokesperson Paul Sams did sit down with us for an interview in which he explained why they were producing the service and how the future of multiplayer was evolving. The article is a fascinating time capsule of a period when online gaming was still something of an uncertainty instead of an industry standard; at the time, it was unknown if online multiplayer services could “make money” on their own. This was a factor that Blizzard ignored in favor of the bigger picture. It’s a wild contrast to the gaming landscape of today, where it is universally understood that digital stores and portals are an integral cog in the machine.
