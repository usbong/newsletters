## KEYPHRASE

> In Japan, such projects are referred to as "doujin soft." That is, games created by hobbyists for fun rather than profit. The term "doujin" literally translates as "same person" but can be taken to mean independent self-published works, which can apply to anything from manga to novels to music. Games have naturally been part of this as early as the 1980s during the rise of the PC, especially with NEC’s popular 8-bit PC-8801 (or PC-88 for short), which was capable of producing detailed pixel art.

> Retro Game Aliens will be the first title Totsuka has published on Steam as a commercial release. Before now, as well as entering magazine competitions, Totsuka would make other visual novels on free engines that had a website allowing creators to promote their work. That's because—unless devs in Japan are also making their own websites to advertise—there simply isn't an infrastructure in place that lets them share their games with a larger audience.

> For doujin communities, there is Comiket, a comic market held bi-annually in Tokyo, where hundreds of thousands attend to buy and sell doujin works. Again, most of the works are not usually sold for huge profit. Alvin Phu, CEO of doujin game publisher Hanaji Games explains, "outside of Comiket, there isn't a strong community or place for people to come together to talk to each other about what they do."
> As well as making games in his own time, Totsuka also works as a game reporter, and it was during a trip to Tokyo Game Show—specifically the 2013 edition when organizers first introduced an indie booth—that he became inspired to start exhibiting his own projects at the event. "You used to see more doujin groups making their own games in a close and isolated community," he says. "But in recent years, there are more [people asking] 'have you found a publisher?' So it's becoming more commercial, and publishers are stepping in to see which games are viable to be published."

> A former veteran at Natsume-Atari, Shibata started as an art designer but had been used to wearing multiple hats at the company, including director for its mobile titles. "I was feeling like I was running a company within the company, so I was confident that with my background I could become a solo developer," he says. "Then when I started my own company, I realized that I didn't know enough, so that's why I joined the incubator."

> While Marvelous gets something out of the program by securing titles they add to their release roster, such as Ninja or Die, program manager Matias Kaala says this is ultimately charity for the company.

> "Usually with programs where they help you and give you money, they have IP rights or something else in return, but we connect developers to a network of over 80 publishers after the program, and all we ask is that they tell us if they are getting an offer, and then we decide if we want to make a counter-offer," explains Kaala. "But in the end, the developer has the freedom to choose who they want to work with."

> ElecHead developer and IGI mentor Nama Takahashi is something of an exception, having made his puzzle-platforming hit while still studying at a specialist game design school. "In school, teachers ask you to go to bigger companies, but I realized there was an indie scene, so maybe if I could do everything then I could try the indie route," he says. Although modest when speaking about his career plans, he already made enough profit from ElecHead to invest in another indie project.

> Notably, Takahashi's itch profile, where ElecHead was first shared as a demo, is also in English.

> Lost in translation

> Ensuring a game can reach a global (read: English-speaking) audience is vital to the success and visibility of Japanese indies. 

## —

> For instance, Totsuka tells us publisher Waku Waku Games decided it would be more profitable to localize Retro Game Aliens in English and Chinese to attract a larger audience in lucrative markets.

> Kickstarters, for instance, rely on international backers. That means it's almost essential to have an English-speaking team run the campaign. If a developer wants their game featured on an international showcase like Day of the Devs or Steam Next Fest, it will often require them to submit English documentation (Asobu incidentally also hosts its own regular online showcases).

> What's more surprising is that, given Japan's reputation as the spiritual home of video games, there's virtually no support from the government for developers in the form of grants, sponsorships, or tax relief. That, though, could soon change.
