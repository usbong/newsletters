### KEYPHRASE

> Octopath Traveler II (Acquire/Square Enix)

オクトパストラベラー大陸の覇者II（アクワイア/スクエア・エニクス）

> In the lead-up to Final Fantasy XVI, the RPG community was at war over that franchise’s future and lamenting its abandonment of its turn-based roots. 

ファイナルファンタジーXVIへ導かれるに伴い、RPGコミュニティーが、フランチャイズの将来に関して争ってきたなか、根付けられてきたターンベース戦闘システムを放棄することを悩んでいた。

> Much like Sea of Stars, Square Enix’s Octopath Traveler II provides an excellent spin on the turn-based formula with its “Break” mechanic. Specific moves and elemental attacks break an enemy’s shield, at which point they’re ripe for attack. Finding out what attacks have break potential can be a little too trial-and-error, but discovering what works (and getting the opportunity to deliver the breaking blow) is always satisfying. It’s easy enough to learn, but gains some complexity when multiple enemies have to be juggled, and serves as incentive to think about party composition.

> Octopath Traveler II’s band of heroes, scoundrels, and well, travelers are all individually engaging and charming right from the outset. Their individual stories each have their own style and tone, and there’s fun in watching them interact with each other and their own supporting casts. The storytelling method also allows for a consistent sense of discovery that comes with arriving at a new region. Even if a character’s tale doesn’t continue in that area, the ability to shift between day and night at will makes each town feel lived in and real, with a sense of continuity beyond the main cast visiting.

> Square Enix appears to love making mid-size RPGs like the Octopath Traveler games in the hopes they find a modest audience. I’m glad that’s the case; while I’m not that familiar with the old-school RPGs it’s pulling from, I can feel the history that Octopath Traveler II is drawing from, and the ways in which it wants to make its own legacy.
