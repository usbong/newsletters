### KEYPHRASE

> This interview is part of our Road to the IGF series. The IGF (Independent Games Festival) aims to encourage innovation in game development and to recognize independent game developers advancing the medium. Every year, Game Developer sits down with the finalists for the IGF ahead of GDC to explore the themes, design decisions, and tools behind each entry.

> RPG Time: The Legend of Wright contains a world of hand-crafted games inside a child's notebook, capturing the feeling of creating games in your sketchbook as a kid.

> Tom Fuji, developer of the Excellence in Visual Art-nominated game, sat down with Game Developer to talk about what drew them to explore this child-like art style, how they captured the feel of a child's video game creations, and their own memories of making games when they were younger.

> <b>Do you have any memories of designing your own games as a child? Do any of those memories stand out very strongly? Do you still have some of those things you made as a kid? </b>
  
> One of my memories from designing my own game was during an athletic field day called "Undoukai." This is an event typical in Japanese elementary schools where students participate in various sports competitions and invite their entire family to watch. 

> My school had this proposal to have students create an original competition and actually play it, and my idea was accepted. If I remember correctly, my idea was to have competitors wear a hat fashioned from a plate with a ball on top and have them run a relay race. Anyone who could usually run very quickly was forced to slow down, and the balls on top of the plates were chosen at random (like soccer balls, tennis balls, or apples) and I remember devising rules and intervals so it would be fun for everyone playing the game.

> I also have this memory of a friend from elementary school who made a handmade game for me. When I was young, I preferred to play games rather than create them, and the time I spent playing the analog game my friend made for me was wonderful. I wanted everyone to experience that same special feeling, which was also one of the reasons I created the game. 

> Additionally, there's a wonderful SNES game titled RPG Maker, and I believe that was the very first time I ever made a video game. Only a handful of the creations I made during my youth were saved, and I regret not saving more.

> <b>What development tools were used to build your game?</b>

> The game uses the Unity engine. Unity was one of the reasons we were able to start development for this game. Because we had a limited budget, we had to work from scratch using Blender when creating 3D models. We used Photoshop, tablets, scanners, and computers, but we also ended up using things like pencils, notebooks, erasers, colored paper, scissors, glue, cardboard boxes, and staplers.

> <b>What's your background in making games?</b>

> I worked in a Japanese game development company as a level designer and director, and I have experience mostly in developing RPG and action games. I've been working for about fifteen years making games.

> <b>Who are you, and what was your role in developing RPG Time: The Legend of Wright?</b>

> My name is Tom Fujii. My main responsibilities included drafting, planning, scenario writing, direction, 3D modeling, UI, and scripting.

> <b>You mention that you have had the idea for fifteen years and that you spent nine years on development. Was it hard to stay focused for so long? How did you keep yourself motivated to work on it for so long?</b>

> My motivation during development was high, and I was literally developing this game every day, day and night. I was so focused on developing RPG Time I may have felt a bit strapped for funds and time, but I also thought that that was a good driving factor in developing this game. I also believed that Kenta's initial desire and drive for creation rubbed off on us. There were many bumps throughout the process, but there weren't many big clashes among the team, and overall the development process was fun.

### â€”

> By developing a bunch of game genres, we fell more in love with games, and realized that making and playing games are both fun.
