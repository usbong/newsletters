### SELECT PARTS

> For Lucic, Devolver's interest in the Australian development scene is rooted in finding the right talent. 

ルシク氏にとって、「Devolver」が持っているオーストラリア開発場面の興味は、相応しい人類の才能に根付いていると。

> He says the company isn't focused on any specific region, but rather follows the creativity–wherever that may be. "Obviously with the big success of Cult of the Lamb, which is developed by Massive Monster based here in Melbourne, we heard from them and other partners that there's a lot of talent here," adds Lucic.

> "...Sometimes you get a really good game, but there's no emotional connection between you and the team and you don't want to work together. [...] We always want to work with people who we see ourselves working with for years to come."

「時にはすごく素晴らしいタイトルを見つけるが、ゲーム開発者チームにつなぐ絆が感情的に無く、そのチームと一緒に働きたくないと・・・やっぱ数年先にも仕事できる人たちと仕事したいんだと、いつもそう思っているんだよな。」

> Devolver says government-backed orgs help it find games

> Lucic notes that one of the major factors behind Devolver's continued flirtation with Aussie devs is the support and funding being dished out to creators and studios by government-backed organizations like VicScreen. "A bunch of us at the company really like the way [VicScreen] approach things and the way they build up the community and support them with funding and mentorship programs. They also help connect them with the right partner. [For instance] they had this one event where they told us 'we want to curate a few games that we see as a good fit for you.'" It's an approach to courting publishers that has evidently won over some of the decision makers at Devolver, and Lucic believes more markets would benefit from similar initiatives.

> "For us, it's always about providing as much information as you can alongside really solid playable builds. When I say 'solid' I don't mean your build has to be super polished. The visuals don't need to be there, but as long as we can feel the core gameplay loop, that's when we're happy."

> suggests that "universally, everybody's looking to feel the hook when they play the actual build." 

> "We don't have to change a lot. We're signing great games and we're having fun working with developers. That's the most important thing for us. If we're having fun and the developers are having fun, and we're all making some money along the way, I think that's the dream."

「自分たちがあんまり変わらなくても良いんだ。素晴らしいゲームをうちに入れていながら、開発者らと楽しく仕事もしていると、やっぱそれが最も大事なことだと思うが、我々だけじゃなく開発者らも楽しんでいることだとすると、みんなが少しくらいでも儲かっていれば良いと、理想として、目指して良いんだよな。」
