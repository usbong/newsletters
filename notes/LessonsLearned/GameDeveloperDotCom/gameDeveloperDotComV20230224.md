> Valve uses "honeypot" to catch and permanently ban 40,000 cheaters in Dota
The company said the latest wave of bans was "particularly large."

### Keyphrase

> Valve has permanently banned over 40,000 players for using third-party software to cheat in Dota. 

> According to Valve, the cheat software being used was able to access information used internally by the Dota client that wasn't visible during normal gameplay, giving offending players an unfair advantage. 

> Valve has now fixed the underlying issues that made those cheats possible, but said it also decided to remove the "bad actors" from the active Dota player base. 

> "We released a patch as soon as we understood the method these cheats were using. This patch created a honeypot: a section of data inside the game client that would never be read during normal gameplay, but that could be read by these exploits," explained Valve.

> Even Neal Stephenson doesn't seem keen on crypto anymore<br/>
> Science fiction author Neal Stephenson gently criticized cryptocurrency in games in his DICE 2023 keynote.

### Keyphrase

> Stephenson's call to the audience was this: when building in-game economies for virtual worlds, devs can't lose sight of the intrinsic value of items—what gives them their worth beyond just artificial scarcity. Here's a quick rundown of his thought process.

> Now Stephenson mused, why would he and his friends want to sell this base? And more importantly, what made these respective items valuable?

> Comparing it to the cow only produced one key overlap: if he and his friends sold their Valheim items through a digital in-game market, they'd be able to live without them. None of the incentives for selling those goods exist in any capacity.

> That's because the value of those in-game goods is mostly sentimental. The sense of personal ownership that came from building the base, the satisfaction of slaying monsters to craft items—that's what gives those items value. Their rarity or difficulty to acquire is only one component of the equation. If in-game items aren't really worth that much to someone else—how can you build a functioning economy on top of them?

> Here Stephenson pivoted to harangue a certain section of the used book market: those selling on the basis of artificial scarcity of aesthetics (think booksellers who sell books to be displayed when arranged by color of cover, or sold with paper wrappings on them for a monochromatic choice). These vendors aren't selling a product anchored on the words in the page, they're selling books based on how someone might react to seeing them on a shelf.
Stephenson described this model as being totally disconnected from the world of the book market—and argued if it were to swallow the entire book business, it would create volatility like the kind that sent cryptocurrencies crashing in 2022.

> And though volatility is good for get-rich-quick types or scammers, it's not good for sustainable online economies. And for this metaverse company co-founder, the sustainability of online worlds trumps the need for anyone to profit from the sale of digital goods.

> "Most people play Warcraft for the joy of it, and for the experiences they have with their friends and enemies," he mused. "They're not particularly eager to liquidate their inventories of virtual goods because the magic swords in those inventories have utility, as well as intangible qualities—the memories associated with pride and achievement."
At some point in the future there may be good reason to have digital in-game goods be as easily sellable as our real physical stuff is. But "stuff" only has value if people give them value.
"It's not just the currency that sets the value of the goods. It's the goods in the aggregate that set the value of the currency."

> Magic beans as a metaphor for cryptocurrency

> In Stephenson's analogy, the magic beans Jack sells the cow for (when he'd been sent to get...uh, FIAT currency) are a good stand-in for cryptocurrency. They're supposed to be able to do all these wonderful things, but in the end they only lead Jack to a violent world of wealth, power, and eventually doom and downfall.
