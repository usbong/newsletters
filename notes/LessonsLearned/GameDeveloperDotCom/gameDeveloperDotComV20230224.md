> Valve uses "honeypot" to catch and permanently ban 40,000 cheaters in Dota
The company said the latest wave of bans was "particularly large."

### Keyphrase

> Valve has permanently banned over 40,000 players for using third-party software to cheat in Dota. 

> According to Valve, the cheat software being used was able to access information used internally by the Dota client that wasn't visible during normal gameplay, giving offending players an unfair advantage. 

> Valve has now fixed the underlying issues that made those cheats possible, but said it also decided to remove the "bad actors" from the active Dota player base. 

> "We released a patch as soon as we understood the method these cheats were using. This patch created a honeypot: a section of data inside the game client that would never be read during normal gameplay, but that could be read by these exploits," explained Valve.
