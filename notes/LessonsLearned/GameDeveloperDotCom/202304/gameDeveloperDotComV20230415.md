### "The power of personality"

> Most big powerhouse accounts on TikTok with game content are those that use their face and personality to drive content. You don't have to be hugely charismatic, just be accessible and present. 

### "Structure"

> It's very important to TikTok's algorithm that your viewers watch the video til the end. So how do you get them do that? Structure the video to hold their attention. You can do this by promising something intriguing and building a pay-off at the end. Gimmicks like Easter eggs, hidden locations, funny glitches, new features, memes, Q&As are all some ways to do a basic set-up and pay-off. 

### "Trends"

> Every app has its own cadence, and it'll be easier to know what that is the more time you spend on TikTok. And remember that while TikTok is a highly visual platform, "Ugly games go viral too," she says. "You just have to give them something compelling to look at." 

### "The subtle art of blending in"

> Anything too polished or nice or too much effort will get tuned out because our generation is too used to advertising. So how do you get people to not turn off your video right away? Make a TikTok that looks like a TikTok by using low production values. After all, why use sophisticated tools when regular ones will do? Blend in with your audience. Average TikTok users don't have high production values. Look like you belong.

### "Beginner's workflow"

> Sounds are the backbone of TikTok, Curtis says. Lean into the platform's strengths by making the most of audio. That means for every video you post, don't forget to search that sound (like a song clip) in the sound library on TikTok to tag the video, which allows other people using or looking for that sound to engage with your content. Do all your editing on your PC in video editing software; do not try to do it all on your phone or you will go "insane." Use the TikTok editor to do some of the fun bits, like adding in voices, and don't forget a keyword-heavy caption, which helps with results. Teens are using TikTok like Google, so it helps to index your content properly. 

> TikTok is such an important platform to pursue, not least of which the fact that TikTok has a billion monthly users, and that the data indicates that Steam page traffic and wishlist spikes can be directly correlated with viral TikToks. TikTok, unlike most platforms, relies on an algorithm that customizes content for the user based on their preferences over time. The goal of the talk, says Curtis, is to teach people how to get on "For You" pages without being shady or cringe, which will drive up wishlists on Steam, kicking in the platform's promotional cycle.
