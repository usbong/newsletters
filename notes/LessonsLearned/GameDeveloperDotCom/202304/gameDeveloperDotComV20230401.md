> "No one" cares about your game. Here's why that can be a good thing

あなたのゲームには、「だれも」興味ない。なぜそれは長所であるかも

> CEO of Future Friends Games, Thomas Reisenegger explains how to use this to your marketing advantage.

> ...era of abundant indie releases, is how to compete for attention in a crowded market and what works to get people's eyeballs on your game. 

インディーゲームがリリースされつつ、市場に対して目立つようになるのが更に難しくなっており、いかにしてうまく競争できるかとの挑戦である。

> Though it's very natural to look to others as an example of what to do or not do, when it comes to the most prominent examples in the games industry, most of the information won't be applicable. Games marketing suffers from what he calls "The Avengers Problem," that is, that triple-A games receive the lion's share of marketing and audience attention, and thus, examining their methods is not particularly helpful. What works for them will not work for games that cannot rely on that level of inherited brand awareness.

他人のゲームと比較し、なにをしようかするまいか、ということが当然だが、ゲーム業界では例えをすると、大半の情報が該当なしである。ゲームマーケティングでは、トリプルエータイトル（高クオリティーであるゲーム）が主なマーケティングや視聴者からの注目を恵まれつつ、「アベンジャーズの困難」という苦しみも抱いており、従ってそういうやり方が、私たちに対してあまり役に立たない。要するに、遺伝されたブランド認識レベルに頼れないゲームだと、やはりそう言った同じやり方で役に立たないことである。

### ACTION

> checklist when preparing communications

コミュニケーションを用意する時のチェックリスト

> Rule 1: Get to the point quick and show what you have immediately. Even taking a few extra seconds to float developer and publisher logos at the beginning of your game trailer can derail the audience's interest. This is important even on the store page. Put the most relevant details out front and center. 

ルール＃１：なにを伝えたいかという点をすぐに見せること。開発者やパブリッシャーのロゴを見せるために、ゲームトレイラー動画で、何秒か少しくらいでもかけると、視聴者からの注目が去って離れていく可能性ある。これは、ストアページに関しても大事である。従って、もっとも関係ある詳細を最初ページの真ん中のところに置いておくこと。

> Rule 2: Make things work for newcomers. Don't assume that everyone viewing your trailer has seen the ones you've previously released, or even know what your game is. Add more framing and context as needed. You lose people immediately if they don’t feel included. 

> Rule 3: Think of the environment. Who is going to watch this and how? Be succinct and highly visual but also take into consideration conventions (for example, TikTok users view videos in portrait, not landscape). Make sure it reads nice visually. Also, know your platform and its strengths. For example, TikTok users will consume videos with audio, so use that to your advantage. 

> Rule 4: Basic sales pipeline. Know your next step. Your audience should know how and where to take the next step in keeping track of that game, even if that's just a link to the Steam page. But also, try to avoid calls-to-action, which are seen as cringe. 

> Macro level marketing

> Just show your game. Never take it for granted that people know about your game at all. Introduce your game as many times as you need to, even when it feels repetitive. Even

> even at an event like the Game Developer Conference, do not have guaranteed brand visibility,

> Metrics might give you the impression that, for example, "everyone" has seen your popular Reddit post or viral TikTok. But maybe someone in your potential audience simply wasn't on that platform that week, or was on honeymoon. Those gaps need to be filled. 

> Bonus: know your money shot. "Knowing what is the one shot that is really really good for your game can lead to change your campaign." Purposefully put it in everything, like your store page or launch email, and especially use it on TikTok. TikTok can act almost as a beta test to figure out the most appealing visual aspects of your game. 

> "Make sure you keep repeating what your game is. Recycle trailers, change them a little bit, put them out again, try different platform. 

> We also had examples where people launched the game on Xbox and Switch, and then they go to PlayStation and all their marketing just talks about the new features of the PlayStation version. But that doesn't make sense, because the PlayStation people have never ever seen your game. For them, it's a completely new game. So you've got to treat it like that. Again, just explain them what the game is."

> Adapt. Reisenegger says that the first three steps are "90%" of the work, and that last bit to take it to 100% is to continue observing: honing into what works for your campaign, and then refining it. Be flexible, expand upon what seems to be drawing the most attention to your game as you go. 

> Understand the reach of multipliers. Some platforms will boost your reach and it's good to have insight into which are the most effective. Also, do not neglect your Steam page. It will far and away be the most important face of your game.

> Reuse, recycle, rinse, repeat. Reuse the assets, recut them; again, show as many times as you can, show as many features as you can. 

> Embrace the chaos and the depth and figure out your multipliers and then prioritize accordingly.
