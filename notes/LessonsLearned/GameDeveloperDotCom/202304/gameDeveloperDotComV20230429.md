### SELECT PARTS

> Many engines allow you to make simple assets (like sprites for 2D games, models for 3D games or sound effects) in the engine environment, and most allow you to make them in another program and import them into the project.

> The Best Free Game Engines

> What is a game engine? It's a collection of software that enables the user (or team of users) to put together assets (like art, animation, sound design and musical elements) with code that gives the instructions for how everything will interact in the game environment. A very simple metaphor is that of a sort of interactive stage play: things like characters, objects, and art/sound assets are like actors and props, and code is like the script of the play and the "rules" of how everything works together as a player interacts.
