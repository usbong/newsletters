> A five-year long endeavor

> The idea for The Elephant Collection came to mind five years ago. As Cooney tells Game Developer over Zoom, he thought it would be a good way of preserving some of his games (a total of ten) by bringing them over to Steam in one package. Not just to present a modernized time capsule of his work in Flash to new audiences, but to share them with people who, up to this day, are still sending him text support emails about these games, and asking if they will ever receive a port.

> "Alongside all the work that went into thinking what does this look [like]," he says, "[such as] how many games should be there, which games are important, should we do all of them or only some of them, life caught up in a lot of ways. I ended up having two children, there was the pandemic, and I shifted roles from Kongregate to Armor Games. And so there were a lot of things going on in my life, and meanwhile, this project was slowly moving forward a little bit at a time."

> Ultimately, the decision to work alongside Armor Games just made sense. Cooney originally joined Armor Games back in 2007, where he stayed up until 2012. He then had a seven-year tenure at Kongregate, until he rejoined Armor Games in 2019 as vice president of business development of Armor Games Studios, and became CEO two years later. Given how intertwined the company has been with his career, he says, it felt natural that they'd be moving forward as a publishing relationship.

> There were a few key factors that Cooney and the team wanted to preserve, especially when attempting to provide a modern experience for these Flash games. Some of his earlier games had a resolution of 550x400 pixels, for example, with one being pretty much the same size as a postage stamp at 250x200 pixels. For The Elephant Collection, they're currently targeting around three times the original size of every individual game.

> "Thanks to Flash being Vector art, it's a lot of art that is drawn in geometry. It's why Flash games were so small back in the day. Instead of transmitting every pixel individually and having these huge file sizes, Flash files would just send instructions like, draw a rectangle from here to here, and that's why games were like 2 MB or something like that. We used to email Flash games to each other."

「FLASHは、ベクター絵によって、幾何学の形として描かれているものである。おかげで、当時からもFLASHゲーム自体がわりと小さい。一枚一枚のピクセルを大きなファイルサイズで移動するではなく、FLASHのファイルは、指示のみ、例えば、長方形の描き方を送るため、サイズがおよそ２MBしか掛からなかった。前よくFLASHゲームを仲間と互いに送り合ったりしてたよ。」

> There's also a particular consideration of what made Flash games so particular. In Achievement Unlocked 2, there's a point at which the objectives list teases you into opening a second game on a second window. "We built a connector that actually chatted with the other window," Cooney explains, "and so they would communicate what was happening in the second window with the first window, so you're actually playing in two screens at the same point. And we had to figure out how to do that. Because, again, the Steam PC experience is, you open up a window and you play a game, there isn't a notion of you opening up a Steam game, and then you open a second Steam game. So we had to come up with workarounds for that to make it still [capture] that experience."

> "[The games] are fully playable but there are little exploits and things that are important to preserve, too. People want to be able to do what they effectively felt was a cheat code 12 years ago, and do it again and feel the impact of that nostalgia. That knowledge that people for some reason put on a shelf in their brain and wanted to put back out at some point," Cooney says.

> During a GDC talk about Flash games, he also mentioned that people would warn him and other creators whenever a portal had stolen one of their games and published it as their own, which was a problem that only became more pervasive over time.

GDCにおいてFLASHゲームの話をすると、人から、誰かがポータルを作成し、盗んだゲームを自分のふりで、発行する警告が来るが、時に連れて、より広がって行っている問題である。

> Games during this web 2.0 period, despite the lack of YouTube, Twitter, and everything else we know of nowadays, still had the potential to be huge hits. Cooney remembers how people would sometimes launch games on a portal like Newgrounds or Armor Games, and within 24 hours they would be at over a million plays already. All the way from Kongregate to the Neopets boards, as well as the array of forums, led to dozens of communities flourishing online. In the case of Flash games, it was a direct line, and a time Cooney has serious nostalgia for.


> The simplicity of the onboarding experience, as well as the familiarity to those who knew the basics of tools like Paint, made Flash so welcoming for many, including Cooney himself. He recalls how easy it was to just build a rectangle, add text, use a paintbrush, and then start creating on the canvas. This would eventually lead to a button, which then resulted in a slideshow where you moved between multiple canvases, and all of a sudden you found out that you could attach different scripts to that first button. So on and so forth.


> To Cooney, there are quite a few reasons why remasters and remakes have become such a common occurrence in the past few years. On one end, he sees it as a demand from people to play a game that was important to them at some point in their lives. "The games we play are memories, they're important milestones in our lives," he says. "They're things that are not just connected to us as players, but they're also tied to the environment that we were at the time. A lot of media does this, but games kind of do it in a special way."


> Regarding the Flash scene in particular, there have been multiple efforts to preserve part of the games and continue having them playable for the foreseeable future. Cooney mentions an emulator to play Apple II games in the Internet Archive, as well as Ruffle, a Flash emulator that acts as a web plugin just like its homage. Yet, he recognizes that preserving these games is a task that comes with volume. Kongregate alone has over 100,000 titles, and the numbers grow exponentially larger for Newgrounds when you group up games alongside animations.


> When it comes to launching games on Steam, for example, it's important to consider how the platform functions and think about the player expectations therein. Some Flash games were 15-second experiences, or encompassed rounds that could be repeated in the span of a few minutes before moving to something else.


> ...that's kind of the beauty of Steam, small indie games launching alongside AAA games. But, also, Flash games look very different, they look very 2000s in a lot of ways, so it's important to also think about how these games are gonna look and what players are looking for."

> ...there is a lot of software available nowadays that is either completely free or free to access, and doesn't present itself as daunting as Unreal Engine or Unity to people who're just starting out. GameMaker, Godot, Construct, and Scratch are some of them. This, too, is important to preserve for future generations.

> ... I think there's a lot of good opportunities, and these tools are only getting better."

> December 31, 2020 marked the day in which Adobe officially ceased support of Flash Player. Starting January 21, 2021, the company blocked Flash content from running with the plugin. This, of course, shuttered hundreds of thousands of games and animations that people had been making for over two decades. Many studios you know of nowadays, such as The Behemoth (Alien Hominid, Castle Crashers) and Cellar Door Games (Rogue Legacy), got their start in Flash.
