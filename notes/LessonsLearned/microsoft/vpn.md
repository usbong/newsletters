> How a VPN protects your IP address

> In addition to encryption, a VPN also masks your IP address from the public internet, in turn masking your identity. When a user successfully connects their computer to the VPN server, the VPN not only secures their data, it also assigns them a new IP address that conceals their real IP address. This may come in the form of a shared IP address, which groups multiple users into a single IP so that activity from any one individual user becomes difficult to discern. This new IP address may also correspond with the IP address of the VPN server, which means the more servers there are across the globe, the more IP addresses you have to choose from. Depending on your needs, this can be configured in the settings of your VPN client.

> When a VPN hides your IP address, it also spoofs, or hides, your location as well. This is useful for bypassing content blocks and firewalls, which rely on your IP to initiate the blocking. IP masking has also proven effective against doxing, where your private identity is made public online, as well as DDoS attacks, or distributed denial of service attacks. If no one knows your real IP address, then no one can launch an attack against you.

> IP address protection

> Greater anonymity is a pivotal reason to use a VPN. When looking for a provider, you'll want to choose one that provides you with options for rerouting your IP address. A shared IP address groups multiple users together under one IP, protecting you from within the crowd, while quick and easy server switching allows you to choose your location from wherever your provider's servers are located.

> Zero-log policy

> You may be hidden from third parties, but in theory, a VPN provider has the power to potentially see everything you do under its protection. Because of this, it's important to go with a company that practices transparency around their logging policy. A zero-log, or no-log VPN provider keeps a record of your email address, payment information, and VPN server, but it shouldn't log or store any data that gets sent while you're securely connected. This includes usage logs, connection logs, session data, or even your IP address.

> Kill switch

> If your secure VPN connection gets interrupted, your computer reverts to your real IP address, in turn compromising your identity. A kill switch prevents this from happening by cutting off your Internet connection as soon as your VPN connection disrupts.
