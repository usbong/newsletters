> Network play<br/>
> <br/>
> Quake includes cooperative and deathmatch multiplayer modes over LAN or the Internet. Additional multiplayer modes were later added using mods.<br/>
> <br/>
> Quake uses the clientâ€“server model, where a server has control of all game events. All players connect to this server in order to participate, with the server telling the clients what is happening in the game. The server may either be a dedicated server or a Listen Server. Even in the latter situation, Quake still uses the client-server model, as opposed to the peer-to-peer networking used by some other games. Quake thus cannot suffer from de-synchronized network games that could occur from different clients disagreeing with each other, since the server is always the final authority.

> Guerrilla is shutting down the servers for multiple Killzone titles and RIGS<br/>
> The most recent Killzone title is almost a decade old.

Isasara na ng Guerrilla ang mga SERVER sa ilan ng kanilang Killzone at RIGS.<br/>
Halos sampung taon na rin ang pinakabagong Killzone.

> "Shadow Fall, a PS4 launch title in 2013, served as the final installment of the series."

Naglingkod bilang huling yugto ng mga magkasunod na yugto ang "Shadow Fall", isang panlabas na pamagat sa PS4 ng Taong 2013.

> "The series' lifecycle spanned the PlayStation 2, PlayStation Portable, PlayStation 3, PS Vita, and PS4."

Umabot ang haba ng buhay ng mga magkasunod na yugto sa PlayStation 2, PlayStation Portable, PlayStation 3, PS Vita, at PS4.

> "The single player campaigns and modes for each game, however, will remain functional."

Gayunpaman, mananatiling kumikilos pa rin ang mga kilusan at mga pamamaraan ng mag-isang manlalaro ng bawat laro.
