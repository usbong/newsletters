> Yoshiki Okamoto is a luminary of the Japanese gaming industry. He got his start in the '80s at Konami, producing arcade classics Gyruss and Time Pilot, before moving to Capcom to work on such hits as 1942, Street Fighter II and Resident Evil.

> In 2004, Okamoto left Capcom and founded his own development studio, Game Republic

> Okamoto was joined in this discussion by Shinichiro Kajitani, executive vice president of Game Republic. 


### --

> So, for example, just talking about personnel, we currently have 280 employees and should have over 300 after April. When we got started, we considered scenarios where we'd have 300 people working for us by this point, but we also imagined what the situation would be like with as many as 500 or as few as 100 employees. 

### --

> The companies that hire us tell us what sort of game they'd like us to make, but it might not be something that's in high demand from a market standpoint. So no, we don't necessarily take on work based on what might be popular.

> However, publishers like Sony may ask us to make a shooting game, another company to make them a racing game, and a third company to make an action game. The money spent on all those games in total is Sony's way of trying to meet the demands of the market. The games we make may not meet the demands of the market on their own, but they may still be necessary. Sony might feel they need to come out with a certain kind of game only because they know the competitor has plans to do the same.

> On the whole, those sorts of things don't have much to do with us. We understand that as a developer, we're sort of one cog in a larger machine. So we don't usually tell the companies who hire us that we want to make a different sort of game than they'd planned. 

### --

> YO: I definitely keep an eye on the global market myself. However, as a company, Game Republic's focus has to follow suit with the needs of the publishers that hire us. We're aware that America has the biggest market, that Europe is the second largest, and that the Japanese market is actually really small. But when we work with Japanese companies, we're usually asked to develop games that will sell well in Japan, and we have to respond accordingly.

### --

> Our goal was to try and hire anybody we thought could be of use in the future, and that's really taken these first three years.

> During the next three, the aim is to really improve the quality of the products we turn out -- to really succeed in this regard. Like, if we can get people to invest in our company now, and if we work hard at this, then by years four, five, and six we'll start being able to make quality games. In the seventh, eighth, and ninth years, the goal will be maintaining that quality. 

### --

> The human resources we've gathered by that point will allow us to start cutting our operating costs. It's generally understood in the [Japanese] market today that a company can start producing interesting games in its fourth, fifth, and sixth years, but still not turn much of a profit. The company is supposed to start making money in years seven through nine, and then those profits can be shared by all the employees. So it's sort of a nine year plan we're on. 


> YO: This is our fourth year. We're about four and a half years old now..

### --

> YO: On the subject of engines, Capcom is the last name we want to be hearing right now. (laughs) I mean, I don't want to think that we're copying them, because I'm supposed to have graduated from there, right? But I also can't deny we want to develop an internal engine like they have. I wonder if I've still got Capcom blood flowing in my veins. 

### --

> YMG: So then, dreams don't come true for people working at Capcom?

> YO: Not as easily, that's for sure. As a creator in a big company, there's never any guarantee that what you want to do will match with what the company wants you to do. But going independent doesn't mean you get to have everything your own way, either. Like I mentioned earlier, we naturally want to return the favor to companies that helped us out when we were getting started. 

> So, they may ask us to make game A. Even though we know it might be better to make game B, they need someone to make A for them, and we're obligated to do it. We've had situations like that. So I guess it's never easy. 

### --

> I felt like my company would have to function well at the national level to succeed, so I ended up choosing Tokyo even though I was born and raised in Osaka. If you need to make business connections, Tokyo's the way to go.

> It felt like if I stayed in Osaka, I'd always sort of be in Capcom's shadow, that we'd end up getting some of their former employees. I didn't think the situation would be good for either of us. People might think I had a grudge against Capcom, and that I was trying to lure people away from them, or something. Or if they opened an office near us, would that mean they were trying to lure people back? I think it would've made it look like the two of us were on really bad terms. Like I'd split off to form another Capcom.

> CN: Insomniac, the creators of Ratchet and Clank, only use internally developed technology, which is seen as sort of controversial considering the popularity of the Unreal Engine in America. Why do you feel an internally developed engine is so important?

> YO: The way I understand it, Unreal seems sort of like an all-purpose engine; it's flexible enough to make nearly any type of game. But it's not like we're out to make games from every genre.

> We tend toward specific types, like action, for example. 

### --

> the catch-all for next-generation engines

> "western game" look to them

### --

> ...it would actually take more time and effort. If you're using an engine someone else has made, it's bound to take a lot of time before you can understand it 100%. Also, when you run into bugs, you're more likely to blame them on someone else. Like, "This has gotta be a bug in the engine!"

> If we build something from the ground up ourselves, the responsibility's also all ours, and knowing that gives you confidence. To me, that's the biggest difference. If we want to do something, and we're told it's not possible with the engine we're using, that could end a project.

> We might get stuck having to tell a client we can't do something they've requested because of the engine we're using. But if it's an engine we've made ourselves we'll know what it's capable of from the outset. More than anything, I want something that we're entirely responsible for, that will bind us together. 

### --

> history repeats itself

> they're going to have to do something to prevent it. It's foolish to keep making the same mistakes people have already made.

### Pinaikling Pagbubuod

> John Carmack has resigned as Meta's executive consultant for VR and left the company after almost a decade. 

> "The issue is our efficiency. Some will ask why I care how the progress is happening, as long as it is happening? If I am trying to sway others, I would say that an org that has only known inefficiency is ill prepared for the inevitable competition and/or belt tightening, but really, it is the more personal pain of seeing a 5 percent GPU utilization number in production. I am offended by it."

> "A good fraction of the things I complain about eventually turn my way after a year or two passes and evidence piles up, but I have never been able to kill stupid things before they cause damage, or set a direction and have a team actually stick to it. I think my influence at the margins has been positive, but it has never been a prime mover."

adds: "...explained he'll now be focused on buildingÂ artificial general intelligence at his startup Keen Technologies."

### Pinaikling Buod

>    Beyond the resellers and scammers, 11 bit freely admitted that what reviews it receives from Curators didn't seem to "bring any value" for the community of its games. 

Higit pa sa mga reseller at scammer, malayang inamin ng 11 bit na walang "idinadagdag na halaga" sa lipunan ng kanilang mga laro, ang kung anumang review (mga puna) na kanilang natatanggap.

> Tomi Toikka, CEO of Finnish developer Makea Games, corroborated 11 bit's claim, saying that Steam keys to his games would soon be resold at G2A or activated without any reviews to show for it.

Sinang-ayunan ni Tomi Toikka, ang CEO ng Finnish developer na Makea Games, ang saad ng 11 bit, at sinabing agad na niyang ibebenta sa G2A o activated kahit walang anumang review ang mga Steam key (susi) ng kaniyang mga laro. 

> Key reselling has been an issue for the PC games industry for years. In 2016, digital game marketplace G2A was called one of the best places to sell stolen game keys, particularly for indie games.

Taun-taon nang sulirinan ang muling pagbebenta ng susi sa larangan ng mga PC na laro. Sa taong 2016, binansagan ang digital na pamilihan ng mga laro, na G2A, bilang isa sa mga pinakamaiging pook, upang magbenta ng mga nakaw na susi ng mga laro, lalo na ang mga indie na laro.

>    Recently, PCGamer reported that Valve banned 20 curator pages after indie developer Cowcat accused multiple curators of trying to get free codes from the developer. After spamming Cowcat's game Brok the Investigator with negative reviews received wider attention, all the Curators involved were banned.

Kamakailan, ibinalita ng PCGamer na BANNED ang 20 mga pahina ng curator, pagkatapos pinaratangan ng indie developer na Cowcat ang maraming curator na nagtangkang kumuha ng mga free code (gratis na code) mula sa developer. Pagkatapos makatanggap ng laganap na pansin ang ginawa nilang spamming ng negative review sa laro ng Cowcat na Brok the Investigator, BANNED na ang lahat ng mga Curator na may kinalaman doon.

Isasara na ng Guerrilla ang mga SERVER sa ilan ng kanilang Killzone at RIGS.<br/>
Halos sampung taon na rin ang pinakabagong Killzone.

Umabot ang haba ng buhay ng mga magkasunod na yugto sa PlayStation 2, PlayStation Portable, PlayStation 3, PS Vita, at PS4.
